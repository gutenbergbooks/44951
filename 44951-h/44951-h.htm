<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>NODDY’S COCOANUT PLANTATION</small></h2>


<p>“Shut your eyes,” called Bob Baker to his
friend Jerry Hopkins, as the two boys sat in the
library of Bob’s home.</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Never mind. Just shut ’em; that’s all.”</p>

<p>“No tricks now. I don’t want a mouthful of
salt, or find that I’m all tangled up in a folding
chair.”</p>

<p>“No, this is something on my own account.
Shut your eyes.”</p>

<p>“All right. Here goes.”</p>

<p>Jerry accommodatingly closed his eyelids. He
opened them almost immediately as he heard a
loud thump in the room.</p>

<p>“What was that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That was yours truly,” explained Bob.</p>

<p>“What doing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>“I threw my Latin grammar and my algebra
over there behind the bookcase.”</p>

<p>“What in the world did you do that for?”</p>

<p>“Because I don’t want to see ’em again until
after vacation, and I didn’t want to see where they
fell for fear I’d be tempted to do some studying
to work off my conditions. And I didn’t want you
to see where they went to for fear you’d tell me.
So I just shut my eyes and let ’em go. They’re
safe, and when they clean house in the fall they’ll
find ’em. It’ll be time enough then to begin studying.
Vacation’s here! Hurrah for a good time
with nothing to do but have fun!”</p>

<p>“That’s so; to-day is the last one for school
for more than two months,” remarked Jerry.</p>

<p>“As if you’d forgotten it!”</p>

<p>“Well, I wasn’t thinking of it, though I’m glad
we don’t have to do any more studying for a
while. There’ll only be the closing exercises this
afternoon and then&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, then what?” asked Bob. “What are
we going to do with ourselves this vacation?”</p>

<p>“Go somewhere in our motor boat I guess,” replied
Jerry. “But isn’t that a Latin grammar I
see sticking out under the edge of the bookcase?”
and he pretended to start to pull forth the volume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you dare touch it!” cried Bob. “Shut
your eyes so you can’t see it!”</p>

<p>Jerry, however, dodging Bob’s outstretched
arms, reached for the book.</p>

<p>“It’s a sea story!” he exclaimed. “Looks
like a good one, too, from the pictures.”</p>

<p>“Give it to me! I was looking all over for
that. Guess I must have dislodged it when I
threw my school books back there. It is a corking
good yarn.”</p>

<p>“Well, Chunky,” went on Jerry (giving Bob
the nickname fastened on him because of his overabundance
of flesh), “are the adventures in that
anything like those we had last summer down at
Harmon Beach?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t touch ’em! Those were ‘adventures
as were adventures,’ as Salt-Water Sam would
say,” remarked Bob, giving his trousers a nautical
hitch in memory of the odd character to which he
referred. “I only hope we are as lucky in striking
a good time this summer as we were on the
Atlantic coast.”</p>

<p>“We generally have been pretty fortunate in
that respect,” said Jerry. “I haven’t thought
much about it this year. I studied rather hard to
win the prize scholarship.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and you got it, which is more to the
point, Jerry. As for me, the harder I bone away
the less I seem to know. I don’t want to hear
school mentioned again for three months. What
do you say to having something to eat?”</p>

<p>“Just had my breakfast. Besides it’s most
time to go to&mdash;Oh, I forgot, you don’t want me
to mention school. Well, I’ll call it the place of
learning.”</p>

<p>“Nobody will be on time this last day,” responded
Bob. “I had breakfast myself, but it
was an early one, and I can eat again.”</p>

<p>“Never saw the time when you couldn’t,” observed
Jerry, taking care to get beyond the reach
of Bob’s fist.</p>

<p>“Have a glass of milk, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t mind that.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to have some and a bit of bread
and jam,” went on Bob, as he disappeared in the
direction of the kitchen.</p>

<p>He came back presently with what looked like
enough for a substantial meal for two hungry
boys. Jerry said nothing, as he was familiar
with the eating capacity of his chum.</p>

<p>“Here comes Ned!” exclaimed Jerry as he
finished his glass of milk. “Better get some more
jam, Bob.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will,” and before Jerry could stop him Bob
had hurried off again. He returned with more
refreshments just as Ned Slade came in.</p>

<p>“Are you fellows going to school to-day?”
asked the newcomer. “It’s almost nine o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Breakfast is now being served in the dining
car!” cried Jerry, imitating the porters on the
Pullman coaches. “It’s Bob’s second attempt,”
he explained.</p>

<p>“You did your share,” retorted Bob. “Have
some, Ned?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks. Three meals a day are enough
for me,” and Ned sat down in a chair to watch
Bob eat.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry. “You
look excited.”</p>

<p>“I met Noddy Nixon, on my way here.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it! So he’s back in town
again. Did you have a quarrel with him?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,&mdash;but we had a discussion. I
can’t stand him. He makes me mad every time
I meet him, and when I thought of how he and
Bill Berry tried to wreck that vessel down on the
coast,&mdash;though I guess Noddy didn’t realize what
a game Bill was playing&mdash;why I feel as though
I wanted to thrash Noddy.”</p>

<p>“Don’t blame you,” said Bob, finishing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
last of the jam and bread and butter. “What
did he have to say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a lot of things, but principally that he
was going down to Florida to take possession of
a cocoanut plantation he’s purchased, or which he
thinks he’s bought. I think it’s all in his mind.”</p>

<p>“Cocoanut plantation!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“Down in Florida?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes. This is how he happened to mention
it,” went on Ned. “I was going past him on the
street without speaking, though I was so surprised
at seeing him that I wanted to ask where he came
from. However, he saved me the trouble. He
hailed me and, in that sneering way of his, he said
he had something that was better than the gold
mine in which we own shares. I didn’t ask him
what it was, but he told me. Said he had bought
a cocoanut grove or farm, or whatever they call
’em, and was going to get rich. He said he was
going down in a week or so to live on the land
and be a wealthy man.”</p>

<p>“Do you s’pose he meant it?” asked Bob.
“I’m very fond of cocoanut pie.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” remarked Jerry with a laugh.
“You’ve got Chunky interested, Ned, as soon as
you mention something good to eat.”</p>

<p>“I guess Noddy was in earnest all right,” went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
on Ned. “He insisted on showing me a lot of
papers. It appears he bought the land through
seeing an advertisement in a magazine. You pay
so much down and so much a month, and the advertisement
says you can make enough raising cocoanuts
to meet all your monthly installments.
Noddy said he had secured a big tract down
there.”</p>

<p>“Where’d he get the money?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“From his father, I s’pose. Mr. Nixon is
rich, and Noddy is the only child. That’s what
makes him spoiled.”</p>

<p>“When’s he going down to the land of the everglades?”
inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“He starts in a week.”</p>

<p>“In what part of Florida is his cocoanut plantation
located?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Near Lake Okeechobee.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to go to Florida,” observed Bob.
“It’s a nice place to read about. Lovely climate,
nothing to do but gather oranges, bananas and
cocoanuts, watch the manatees and turtles, lie in
the shade and&mdash;and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Get eaten up with sand fleas,” put in Jerry.
“They have ’em down there as big as sparrows.”</p>

<p>“I guess if we’re going anywhere we’d better
be starting for school!” exclaimed Ned. “It’s
after nine o’clock.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>The three chums left Bob’s house and strolled
along the street in the direction of the academy
they attended. Ned continued his recital of his
encounter with Noddy, the town bully who, on
more than one occasion, had proved himself the
enemy of the three friends.</p>

<p>“Oh, he talked a lot about how rich he was
going to be,” went on Ned. “He thinks his
cocoanut grove is going to put our gold mine in
the shade. Says he’ll buy us out in a few months.
He was so excited that I guess he forgot all
about how he acted down at Harmon Beach last
summer until I asked him if he calculated to wreck
any steamers on the Florida coast. That made
him mad and we had quite a discussion. That’s
what ruffled me up. I left him spouting about
what he expected to do with his cocoanuts.”</p>

<p>“I guess all the cocoanuts he’ll raise wouldn’t
make enough pies to satisfy Bob’s appetite,” remarked
Jerry. “But we’d better hurry, if we
want to get to school before noon.”</p>

<p>None of the chums realized what a part Noddy
and his cocoanut plantation were to play in their
experiences that summer, nor in what an unexpected
manner they were to render the bully a
service.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>PROFESSOR SNODGRASS ARRIVES</small></h2>


<p>The three chums quickened their pace and were
soon at the academy, where they were greeted by
a number of boy friends.</p>

<p>“Where are you fellows going this vacation?
Out west, down to Mexico or the North Pole?
Lots of fun&mdash;never say die&mdash;right side up with
care&mdash;automobiles&mdash;motor boats&mdash;flying machines&mdash;don’t
stop&mdash;red flag&mdash;danger&mdash;never
mind&mdash;go on&mdash;whoop!”</p>

<p>“Let up, Andy Rush!” exclaimed Jerry,
laughing. “Give us a chance to catch our breath,
please,” and he looked at a small boy who, in
the stress of excitement, (which was the state he
was continually in), was trying to talk to the
three chums at once.</p>

<p>“But I want to know,” insisted Andy.</p>

<p>“We don’t know ourselves,” replied Bob.
“Go get a drink of ice water, Andy. Your windpipe
must be hot after all that.”</p>

<p>There was a general laugh at the small boy’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
expense, and then the pupils went inside. While
they are thus off the stage for a brief period opportunity
will be afforded to make the reader better
acquainted with them.</p>

<p>The three chums, who, because of their long
association with each other, and the part an automobile
and motor boat had played in their adventures,
had come to be known as the “Motor
Boys,” lived in the town of Cresville, not far
from Boston. They were Jerry Hopkins, son of
a widow who was well-to-do, Ned Slade, whose
father owned a large department store, and Bob
Baker, the offspring of a rich banker.</p>

<p>In the first volume of this series, entitled “The
Motor Boys,” was related how the chums became
possessed of motor cycles and how, by taking part
in races, they won a large touring car. Their adventures
on the motor cycles were more than
equalled by those that happened to them when
they had their auto, as was told in the second
book, “The Motor Boys Overland.” They conducted
a successful search for a gold mine in Nevada,
and aided an old prospector in securing it,
though Noddy Nixon and his crony Bill Berry
tried to get it away from them. It was on this
trip that the boys became acquainted with Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Uriah Snodgrass, a learned man whose hobby
was collecting bugs and butterflies.</p>

<p>In recognition of their aid the boys were given
shares in the gold mine, which paid well. It
was this mine to which Noddy referred when he
boasted to Ned of his cocoanut grove.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of Professor Snodgrass the
boys decided to take another trip, as described in
the third volume of this series, “The Motor
Boys in Mexico.” In this they discovered a
buried ancient city, had fights with the Mexicans,
and Bob was kidnapped but escaped.</p>

<p>Deciding to visit their mine on their way back
to the United States, the three chums had rather
a hard time of it. Their doings and the things
that happened to them are told in the fourth book
of the series, “The Motor Boys Across the
Plains.” They rescued a small boy from the
hands of a bad gang of men, and this boy proved
to be the son of a queer hermit, who lived on the
shores of a lake.</p>

<p>The boys reached home safely, and with quite a
sum of money to their credit. With part of this
they purchased a fine, large motor boat, called the
<i>Dartaway</i>. In her they had a series of adventures
on river and lake, as related in “The Motor Boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Afloat.” They took part in races, won a prize,
discovered the mystery of a strange schooner
and cleared up the robbery of Mr. Slade’s department
store.</p>

<p>But more exciting times awaited them. Their
next vacation (for all their fun was had during
the summers when there was no school) was spent
at Harmon Beach, on the Atlantic coast, as
recorded by me in “The Motor Boys on the Atlantic.”
There they made the acquaintance of
“Salt-Water Sam,” an old sailor and whaler, and
with him made a successful chase after a whale
and a shark. They also uncovered a plot to
change the signals in a lighthouse, so that a
steamer might be lured on the rocks, foiling the
men, and aiding the aged keeper and his niece
Jess.</p>

<p>Noddy Nixon, as the partner of Bill Berry
(though Noddy claimed he did not know of the
enormity of the offense) had a hand in the lighthouse
plot. As soon as it failed Bill Berry disappeared
and Noddy was not to be found for some
time. Then, as there was no charge against him,
Noddy returned to his home. His father would
believe nothing wrong concerning him, and the
bully was soon as bold as before. Being well
supplied with money he had spent some of it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
buying land in Florida, as Ned has already related.
Bill Berry did not come back to Cresville,
which fact made the three chums rejoice, for they
did not wish to see that rascal again.</p>

<p>“Closing exercises this afternoon, which will
be short and sweet,” observed Bob, as he and his
friends came from the academy at noon, “and
then to map out a summer campaign.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we want to get busy,” said Ned. “No
use wasting time. You fellows come to my house
to-night and we’ll look over some maps and plan
a cruise. The motor boat is better than ever with
the improvements we put on her last fall.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be there,” called Jerry, as he left his two
chums. “I’ve got to go on an errand for my
mother now, but I’ll be on hand after supper.”</p>

<p>“So will I,” added Bob. “I may be a little
late though, because&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Because he has to eat so much supper; eh,
Chunky?” and Jerry laughed as he shot that
parting shaft.</p>

<p>“I promise to provide a light lunch at ten
o’clock if you’ll stay that late,” called Ned. “So
long!”</p>

<p>The afternoon exercises passed off successfully,
and with farewells from their teachers the three
chums, as well as all the lads in the academy, bade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
good-bye to the place of learning and scattered
for the long summer vacation. The motor boys,
who were all in the same class, walked down the
street, arm in arm, as three fine lads as one could
wish for,&mdash;tall, strong, full of recourse in times
of danger, brave and fearless&mdash;excellent types of
the American Boy.</p>

<p>“Let’s each think of some plan for a trip,” proposed
Ned, as they parted to go to their several
homes. “We can talk ’em all over to-night.”</p>

<p>A few hours later the three chums were at Ned’s
house. On the library table he had spread out a
number of geographies, guide books and maps,
and the boys were soon pouring over them. They
talked a perfect babble, the only things that could
be distinguished now and then being such expressions
as:</p>

<p>“How about a trip to Maine?”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with doing the Gulf of
Mexico?”</p>

<p>“We could go to Cuba if the weather kept
good.”</p>

<p>“The Bermudas aren’t so very far off.”</p>

<p>“Say, we’ll never settle anything this way,”
called Ned after an hour had been spent in fruitless
discussion. “I’ve got a plan.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let each one write on a slip of paper the
place he’d like to go to. We’ll drop the slips in
a hat and one of us, blindfolded, can pull a slip
out. We’ll go wherever the slip says.”</p>

<p>“Suits me,” exclaimed Bob, and Jerry nodded
assent.</p>

<p>Pencils and paper were provided, and the boys
were about to write down their choices when there
came a knock on the library door. A moment
later the portal opened and Mr. Slade was looking
in on the chums.</p>

<p>“A visitor to see you,” he announced.</p>

<p>“To see who?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“All three of you. Let me present Professor
Uriah Snodgrass.”</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass!” exclaimed the three
boys in a surprised chorus. “Where did he come
from?”</p>

<p>“I just arrived,” announced a little man with
very large spectacles, as he stepped past Mr. Slade
and bowed to the boys. “I reached town this
afternoon, and inquired for Mr. Slade’s store, as
I had some business to transact. He heard my
name, and remembered me. He invited me to
call this evening, and&mdash;here I am.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and just in time, too,” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“How is that? Have you just captured a rare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
specimen of a mosquito or a June bug for me?”
and the professor was ready at once to mount his
hobby and start off on a scientific discussion.</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” answered Ned, “but we are
trying to decide where to go in our motor boat for
our vacation. Perhaps you can help us out.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” the professor replied. “I
never took a vacation in my life, and I do not
know where would be a good place to spend one.
I know where I am going this summer.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I am going to Florida, to search for a very
rare butterfly. It is pink, with blue and gold
wings, and a certain museum has offered me five
thousand dollars for a perfect specimen. It is to
be found in Florida only, and I am off for the
everglades next week.”</p>

<p>“That’s a lot of money for a butterfly,” remarked
Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, but the museum can afford it,” went on
the scientist. “No other scientific place in the
world has this kind of a butterfly and the museum
I speak of will be the envy of all the others. But
it is not only for the money that would come to
me that I would like to get that butterfly.</p>

<p>“If I succeed I hope to get a position with the
museum. A sort of commission to travel for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
them into all parts of the world after curious bugs
and relics. That is my ambition, and that is why
I am going to try for this butterfly. It means a
great deal to me, as, all my life, I have wanted to
be on the staff of some good museum, in order
to search for curiosities for it. So you see it is
not only the five thousand dollars I am after,
though, of course that sum will be very acceptable.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you can find the butterfly?”
asked Mr. Slade, much interested.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” replied Uriah Snodgrass. “As I
have said, it is very rare, and very difficult to catch.
I have read of a number of specimens being found
but they were in poor condition, or discolored, and
it is for the rare coloring of this species that it is
desired by the museum.”</p>

<p>“I hope you are successful,” answered Ned’s
father. “I have often wondered, when looking
at the collection of insects in a museum, how they
got so many different kinds. Now I understand.
It is due to the efforts of such men as you.”</p>

<p>Jerry arose from his chair. The light of excitement
gleamed in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I have it, fellows,” he cried.</p>

<p>“What! Not that rare pink butterfly?” cried
the professor, showing great interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, but a plan. Let’s go to Florida in the
<i>Dartaway</i>. It will be a fine trip. We’ll take
you with us, Professor. There’s lots of room.”</p>

<p>For a moment no one spoke. Jerry stood up
looking from his chums to the professor, and then
to Mr. Slade.</p>

<p>“I would like nothing better than to go with
you boys,” Mr. Snodgrass answered. “When
can you start?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow!” cried Ned. “That’s a fine
idea, Jerry! That beats drawing papers from a
hat. Florida it is! What do you say, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be better. I always was fond of
oranges and cocoanuts.”</p>

<p>“Then we’re off for the everglades!” exclaimed
Ned, beginning to do a dance around the
room. “Can we go, father?”</p>

<p>“Well, I presume it’s no use saying no, so I
may as well consent,” answered Mr. Slade.
“But I guess it will take you longer than until
to-morrow to get ready.”</p>

<p>“We can start next week,” put in Jerry.
“That will suit the professor.”</p>

<p>“Excellent,” spoke the scientist, as he began
creeping up on an unsuspecting June bug that
was crawling on the table.</p>

<p>“That settles it!” remarked Ned. “Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
let’s get a geography and lay out a line of
march.”</p>

<p>“Is my son here?” asked a woman’s voice, and
the boys looked up to see Jerry’s mother and Mrs.
Slade standing in the library door.</p>

<p>“Here I am,” replied Jerry. “What is it,
mother?”</p>

<p>“I was calling in this neighborhood,” went on
Mrs. Hopkins. “I knew you were here and I
thought I’d step in and ask you to take me home.”</p>

<p>“Of course I will, mother. We were just
planning another cruise.”</p>

<p>“You’re always doing that,” said Mrs. Hopkins
with a sigh. “I can’t see why you boys
don’t stay home one vacation.”</p>

<p>“We want to see the world,” declared Ned.
“This time we are going to Florida.”</p>

<p>“Florida?” asked Mrs. Hopkins as if surprised.</p>

<p>“Why not, mother?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose that place is as safe as any. I
was just thinking of something,” Mrs. Hopkins
went on. “I once bought some land in Florida,
but after I got the deed I received word that the
property was practically worthless and I never did
anything about it. I have the old deed home
now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where is this land, mother?” asked Jerry.
“I never heard you speak of it.”</p>

<p>“No, because I was sorry I lost the money I
paid for it. The land is somewhere in the central
part of the state I believe. I’ll show you the deed
when we get home.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and if we get to Florida we’ll look up
this property,” went on the widow’s son. “Perhaps
it has increased in value. This gives us another
reason for going to the everglades,” and he
laughed.</p>

<p>Once more the three boys began scanning the
maps and guide books, while Mrs. Hopkins and
Mrs. Slade conversed about household matters.
A little later Jerry escorted his mother home and
she showed him the old deed, of which he took
possession.</p>

<p>“Who knows but what it may prove valuable,”
he said.</p>

<p>“I hope it does,” remarked Mrs. Hopkins.
“I would like to get my money back.”</p>

<p>Jerry returned to Ned’s house, promising his
mother to come home again as soon as more details
of the proposed trip were settled.</p>

<p>“Don’t lose that deed,” cautioned Mrs. Hopkins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry, with a laugh, promised to keep it safely.
He found his chums still discussing the best means
of getting to the land of the everglades. They
little realized what lay before them, nor what was
to happen before they reached Cresville again.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>OFF FOR FLORIDA</small></h2>


<p>At first the boys had an idea they could go
down the Atlantic coast in their motor boat, and
so reach the beautiful land for which they were
bound. But the professor pointed out the terrors
of Cape Hatteras, which is a menace to even big
vessels, so the chums decided on another plan.
They would ship the boat from Cresville to St.
Augustine and travel there themselves by rail.
From St. Augustine they could start down the
coast, and go up the Indian river.</p>

<p>“Can’t we stop there a while?” asked Bob at
this point.</p>

<p>“What for?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“Why that’s where the best oranges in the
world grow,” explained Bob, as if that was reason
enough. “Indian river oranges are fine!”</p>

<p>“You can stay there,” said Jerry. “We’ll go
on to the everglades.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to stay all alone,” remonstrated
Bob. “You might wait while a fellow gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
a few oranges, though,” and he assumed an injured
air.</p>

<p>“The trouble is your idea of a ‘few’ would
mean a boat load,” came from Ned. “But I
guess we can gather some as we sail along.”</p>

<p>“Where do you plan to go from Indian
River?” asked Mr. Slade.</p>

<p>“We’ll land at Titusville,” replied Jerry, running
his finger along the map, “and then&mdash;”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a sudden movement on
the part of Professor Snodgrass, who had ceased
to take part in the conversation, and an instant
later the room was in darkness.</p>

<p>“I’ve got him!” cried the scientist eagerly.
“He’s in my hand on the table, but I’m tangled
up in the gas lamp hose. I must have touched
the stop-cock and turned off the light. Don’t
move, please, any of you. Some one strike a
light so I can see to put my prize safely away.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Mr. Slade as he ignited
one of the gas jets of the chandelier.</p>

<p>“One of the rarest specimens of June bugs,”
was the professor’s answer. “I saw him crawling
on the table and I made a grab for him. He
was right under the gas hose hanging down from
the chandelier to the table lamp, but I didn’t think
of that. I hope I didn’t hurt any one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, you only scared Bob out of his appetite,”
said Ned.</p>

<p>“No, you didn’t!” exclaimed Bob. “I’m as
hungry as&mdash;I thought you said you were going
to give us a lunch, Ned? I’m ready&mdash;” Then
he stopped, in confusion, for the others burst out
into a laugh at him.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, Chunky. You’ll get your
lunch in time,” spoke Ned. “But let’s get this
trip settled first. Have you ever traveled in Florida,
Professor?”</p>

<p>“I caught some of the finest snakes there you
ever saw,” replied the scientist. “I have been
over a considerable part of the state, and I’ll be
glad to renew my acquaintance with it again.”</p>

<p>“Then you can tell us if our plan is a good
one,” went on Ned, informing Mr. Snodgrass of
what the boys proposed to do. From Titusville,
Ned explained, they would go by rail, with their
boat, to Lake Tohopekaliga, through the canal
connecting that body of water with Lake Hatchenana,
across the latter lake, and again by canal
to Lake Kissimmee. From there they would go
by the Kissimmee river to Lake Okeechobee.</p>

<p>“That will give you plenty of opportunity for
testing your motor boat,” said the professor. “I
think the route is a good one. The lower part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Lake Okeechobee is wild enough to suit any one,
and I may be able to find there the rare butterfly
for which I am searching. I will be very glad to
go with you, and I’ll be ready to start any time
you boys fix.”</p>

<p>Having given that much attention to the proposed
trip, the scientist devoted himself to the
June bug, which was struggling to escape from
his hand. Mr. Snodgrass produced a small box,
with a perforated cover, and in it shut the protesting
captive.</p>

<p>That done he jotted down in his note book
certain facts about the bug, its size, date of capture
and the circumstances under which the catch
was made. The professor was nothing if not
methodical.</p>

<p>“Then the first thing to be done,” observed
Ned, when he and his chums had once more gone
over the map to see if they had selected the best
route, “is to get the boat ready for the trip by
rail. I fancy the <i>Dartaway</i> doesn’t like being
shipped on a car. She likes the water too well.”</p>

<p>“No help for it,” remarked Jerry. “Some
day we’ll have a big enough boat to sail half way
round the world in, and we’ll not have to depend
on trains.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if we’ll meet Noddy when we get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to Florida,” mused Bob. “Where did he say
his cocoanut grove was, Ned?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t say, exactly, except that it wasn’t
far from Lake Okeechobee, and I didn’t care
enough to ask him. It’s somewhere in the lower
part, I believe. But I hardly think we’ll meet
him. Hope we don’t, for we always have bad
luck as soon as he or Bill Berry turns up.”</p>

<p>“I guess Bill will keep out of sight for some
time to come,” remarked Mr. Slade, who was listening
to the talk of the boys. “I understand the
United States government is after him for his part
in the lighthouse plot, and when Uncle Sam wants
a man he generally gets him. So I think Bill will
not trouble you this trip. Well, have you settled
everything?”</p>

<p>“Pretty nearly,” answered Ned. “All except
that I’ll have to have some money for my share
of the expenses.”</p>

<p>“I expected that!” exclaimed Mr. Slade with a
laugh. “It takes money, as well as gasoline, to
make a motor boat go. Well I don’t mind, as
long as you boys take care of yourselves and don’t
get into mischief.”</p>

<p>As the parents of the boys were well off there
was no difficulty on the score of funds, though, for
that matter, the lads’ shares in the gold mine were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
more than sufficient to pay their way on the various
trips they made.</p>

<p>They discussed their plans in detail, now and
then appealing to Professor Snodgrass for his
opinion, but the scientist was busy looking for a
specimen of a black snapping bug which had flown
in through a hole in the screen to get at the light,
so he paid little attention to what the boys were
saying.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess that’s all,” announced Ned, as
he closed the big geography. “We’ll start getting
the boat crated up to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” asked Bob, with rather a blank
look.</p>

<p>“Yes, what else is there to discuss?” inquired
Ned.</p>

<p>“Chunky would like to discuss that lunch you
promised,” said Jerry with a laugh. “Eh,
Chunky?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;” began Bob, looking somewhat
sheepishly at Mr. Slade.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind me,” put in that gentleman. “Go
ahead with whatever you had planned. The professor
and I will go out on the porch. I’ll smoke
a cigar to drive the mosquitoes over to Mr. Snodgrass
so he can catch ’em and sell ’em to a museum,”
and he laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys had their lunch, and, in justice to Bob
it must be said that Ned and Jerry ate almost as
much as he did. They talked, between bites, of
their trip, and indulged in all sorts of conjectures
as to what adventures might lie before them.
They imagined strange enough ones, but they were
as nothing to what really befell them when they
got to the land of the everglades.</p>

<p>The little party broke up about midnight, with
mutual promises on the part of the chums to meet
early the next morning and get the <i>Dartaway</i> in
shape for the long trip.</p>

<p>They met at the river dock, where their boat
was kept, and gave the craft a good overhauling.
Some changes had been made in the craft since the
trip on the Atlantic coast. The boat was more
powerful, and was so arranged that they could
sleep on board, for it had a portable awning and
side curtains that could completely enclose the
craft. Larger bunkers for the stowing away of
provisions and water had been put in, the machinery
had been overhauled and, save for a few minor
changes, the <i>Dartaway</i> was ready for a long trip.
These changes were made during the next two
days, and then the boat was enclosed in a stout
cradle. It was put aboard a flat car and, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
end of the week, had started on the journey to St.
Augustine.</p>

<p>As the boys were walking up the street from
the depot they met a man with a small gray moustache,
who looked sharply at them.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” he said, “but can you tell me
where I can find a Mr. Noddy Nixon? I’m a
stranger in town, and I want to see him on business.”</p>

<p>“We can show you where he lives,” replied
Jerry, “but he isn’t home.”</p>

<p>“Where has he gone?” and the man looked
surprised at the news.</p>

<p>“He told me he was going to Florida, to look
at a cocoanut grove he had purchased,” interposed
Ned.</p>

<p>“What part, if I may ask?”</p>

<p>“Near Lake Okeechobee.”</p>

<p>“That’s where we’re going,” put in Bob, who
was rather impetuous.</p>

<p>“Indeed! Are you friends of his?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” replied Ned, stiffly.</p>

<p>“Then you’re not going together?”</p>

<p>“No, he has already started. We’re going
from St. Augustine in our motor boat,” came
from Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you expect to see young Nixon there?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe we will,” remarked Jerry,
wondering at the man’s questions.</p>

<p>“If you do I wish you would hand him this
paper&mdash;no, I think perhaps I had better try and
send it through the regular channels,” and the
man seemed in doubt. “Would you give him a
message if you saw him?” he asked.</p>

<p>“We’d be glad to do you a favor,” said Ned.
“What’s it about?”</p>

<p>“Just tell him to come home at once,” was the
answer, and the man seemed very much in earnest.
“It is very important. I can’t tell you just what,
but say to him that if he does not come voluntarily
we will have to&mdash;. No, perhaps you had better
not say that. It might frighten him, and we
don’t want to do that. Just tell him to come
home to attend to a matter of which he has already
received official notice,” and the man returned
a bundle of papers to his pocket.</p>

<p>“We’ll do it,” spoke up Ned, “though we’re
not sure of seeing him.”</p>

<p>“I understand. It’s only a chance, but I will
be glad to take advantage of it, and I will appreciate
it very much if you can get that message to
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The man moved off up the street, leaving the
three boys somewhat puzzled.</p>

<p>“I wonder who he was?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“No; who was he?”</p>

<p>“One of the government inspectors of lighthouses.
I saw him down at Harmon Beach after
Noddy and Bill, and the others in the gang, tried
to wreck the steamer by showing false lights.”</p>

<p>“Then he’s after Noddy for his part in that!”
exclaimed Ned. “But I thought they weren’t going
to prosecute Noddy?”</p>

<p>“Maybe they want him for a witness against
Bill Berry,” suggested Jerry. “At any rate we’ll
give him the message if we see him. He’s to
come home to attend to a matter of which he has
already received official notice. Probably he’s
been subpœnaed and has skipped out for fear of
arrest. Maybe that’s why he said he was going
to his cocoanut grove. Say, boys, I’ll wager Noddy
has gone to Florida to hide!”</p>

<p>“But why doesn’t the government attend to its
own affairs and not ask us to tell Noddy to come
back?” inquired Ned. “That’s a queer way of
doing business.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they haven’t any officials down near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Lake Okeechobee,” replied Jerry. “It’s rather
desolate down there, I guess, and it would be hard
work to hunt around for an unknown cocoanut
plantation and locate Noddy. Maybe the matter
is not of much importance, and that man may
think we’ll do to deliver the message. Anyway
I believe I’m right and that Noddy has fled from
Cresville because he’s afraid of something in connection
with the attempt to wreck the steamer, and
his part in the attack on Mr. Hardack, the lighthouse
keeper.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see Noddy get his desserts,” interposed
Bob. “He’s done us a lot of mean turns,
but, somehow or other he always manages to
sneak out of the consequences. If I get a chance
I’ll scare him with this message. I’ll tell him
the government detectives are after him with a
pack of bloodhounds.”</p>

<p>“Better wait until we find him,” advised Jerry.
“Lake Okeechobee is a big place and there’s a
slim chance that we will meet Noddy.”</p>

<p>“I thought there was something more than a
new cocoanut plantation that made him want to
hurry out of town,” spoke Ned. “I remember
now he acted, while he was talking to me, as if
he was afraid of some one.”</p>

<p>“That was your imagination,” said Jerry with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
laugh. “But come on; let’s go home and get
ready for the trip, and let Noddy’s affairs take care
of themselves.”</p>

<p>The boys packed their belongings, bade their
friends good-bye and, on Wednesday of the following
week, were ready to start on their trip
to the quaint old city of St. Augustine.</p>

<p>“I hope the boat is there, waiting for us,” remarked
Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes. It wouldn’t be much of a joke if it
went astray,” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>“All ready?” asked Professor Snodgrass, as
he came down to the depot.</p>

<p>“All ready,” replied Ned.</p>

<p>The scientist seemed to have suddenly increased
in size, for he bulged out on all sides.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Jerry, looking in wonder
at his learned friend.</p>

<p>“What? Oh, those are specimen boxes I put
in my pockets. I had no room for them in my
trunks,” Mr. Snodgrass answered. “I also have
a portable net for capturing insects with. I must
lose no opportunities. I may see some valuable
insects on my way down.”</p>

<p>“Here comes the train!” exclaimed Bob, as a
whistle sounded in the distance. “Get your baggage
together!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a confused scramble, as there always
is at the last minute, no matter what preliminary
preparations have been made. The boys and the
professor gathered up their grips, for their trunks
had been checked. The train rolled into the station.
They scrambled up the steps, and got seats
together. Just as the train was pulling out of
the depot the boys heard some one yelling at
them.</p>

<p>“Hold on! Wait a minute! Stop! I want to
speak to you!” was the cry.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>THE GIANT TURTLE</small></h2>


<p>The three chums thrust their heads from the
windows nearest them.</p>

<p>“It’s Andy Rush!” exclaimed Jerry, as he
caught sight of the boyish figure running down
the station platform. “Wonder what he
wants?”</p>

<p>By this time Andy was under the windows on
the side of the car where the boys sat. The train
had not yet gathered much headway.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Ned. “Has anything
happened?” for the small chap seemed quite excited.</p>

<p>“I wanted to see you last night&mdash;couldn’t&mdash;had
too much to do&mdash;got up early this morning&mdash;came
down here on the run&mdash;saw the
train moving&mdash;yelled&mdash;engineer wouldn’t stop&mdash;say&mdash;if
you catch any manatees down there&mdash;Florida
I mean&mdash;save me a little one&mdash;I want
to tame it&mdash;will&mdash;you&mdash;please&mdash;can’t talk
any&mdash;more! Out&mdash;of&mdash;breath!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time Andy was being distanced by the
train and his wind was almost expended.</p>

<p>“I’ll bring you one!” cried Bob, who was
good natured and always ready to accommodate
a friend. “I’ll bring you one, Andy,” and he
waved his hand to the excited boy.</p>

<p>“I say, Professor,” went on Bob, a little later,
“are there any manatees in Florida?”</p>

<p>“There used to be quite a number but I’m
afraid they have been mostly killed off. Still
there may be a few. Why?”</p>

<p>“A friend of mine wants one and I promised
to bring him a little one. If you happen to see
any, please let me know.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if Bob has any idea of the size of a
manatee or sea-cow?” put in Jerry, with a little
smile. “How large do they grow, Professor?”</p>

<p>“Well I have seen them weighing nearly a
thousand pounds, but I suppose the average is
nearer eight hundred.”</p>

<p>“There you are, Bob!” exclaimed Ned with a
laugh. “You see what you’ve promised to send
to Andy.”</p>

<p>“I meant a baby one,” and Bob seemed confused.</p>

<p>“I think even a baby manatee will be beyond
your abilities to ship up North,” Mr. Snodgrass answered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
“They are of good size but rather delicate.
They have to be transported in tanks of
salt water and even the museums have difficulty
in getting them and keeping them alive. I’m
afraid Andy will have to be content with some
other kind of pet.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t any idea they were as big as that,”
murmured Bob. “Never mind, I’ll get him
something else.”</p>

<p>“Try a nice pine snake, about ten feet long, or
a copper-head, or a wild loon, or a turtle,” suggested
Ned. “Andy won’t care what you bring,
as long as it’s a souvenir from Florida. Ship him
a chunk of the everglades.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you make mistakes sometimes,
so you needn’t be so smart!” exclaimed Bob, a
bit sensitive at the fun being poked at him.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Chunky,” consoled Jerry.
“I see they have a dining car on this train so you
needn’t go hungry, at all events.”</p>

<p>“Is there, really?” asked Bob. “That’ll be
fine. I always like to eat in a dining car. I
wish it was time for dinner.”</p>

<p>The journey by train was an uneventful one.
In due time the travelers arrived at St. Augustine,
and found that their boat had reached there in
good condition. They arranged to have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
empty cradle sent to Titusville, where they would
again begin to travel by train until they reached
Kissimmee City, on the shores of Lake Tohopekaliga.</p>

<p>“Then for a long voyage on water!” exclaimed
Ned, as they left the freight house, having seen
to the transportation of their boat to the harbor
of St. Augustine.</p>

<p>They spent one day in St. Augustine, buying
provisions and a supply of gasoline for the <i>Dartaway</i>.
The boat, too, needed soaking in the water
to close the seams which had dried open on the
journey overland.</p>

<p>Bright and early one morning the three boys
and the professor, having placed all their baggage
on board, took possession of the <i>Dartaway</i>.</p>

<p>“We’re off!” cried Jerry as he gave a long
toot to the compressed air whistle. “Now for
the manatees, Chunky!”</p>

<p>“Let up on manatees!” pleaded Bob. “Can’t
you forget ’em?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but think how disappointed Andy will
be,” and Jerry laughed as he gave the wheel a
turn, shoved over the gasoline and sparking levers,
while Ned cranked the engine.</p>

<p>There was a sort of sigh from the <i>Dartaway’s</i>
motor, a cough, a wheeze, and then a series of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
throbs that told that the engine was in working
order. A mass of foam appeared at the stern
where the screw was churning the water, and the
boat moved out of the harbor of the historic city.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day and the boys were in excellent
spirits over the successful start of their
trip. The engine was working to a charm, and
the <i>Dartaway</i> seemed like a thing alive, so well
did she answer to the slightest turn of the steering
wheel.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this glorious!” exclaimed Jerry, as he
sat in the bow. “Can you beat this, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Not in a thousand years!” cried Ned enthusiastically.
“Let Noddy Nixon have his cocoanut
groves, but give me a motor boat and a trip
to Florida!”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute! Hold on! Stop the boat!”
cried the professor suddenly.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry, slowing
down the engine. “Did you lose something?”</p>

<p>The scientist seemed to be struggling to get at
something in the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>“It’s a very rare dragon fly,” he said as he
brought out a butterfly net. “I just saw him
floating on a bit of wood. I must have him for
my collection. He’s worth a hundred dollars!”</p>

<p>The professor made a sudden lunge, thrusting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
his long-handled net over the side of the craft.
He would have gone overboard had not Ned
caught him by the waist and held him.</p>

<p>The net went into the water with a splash, but,
despite his undignified position the professor managed
to bring it aboard. He looked into it anxiously.</p>

<p>“I got him!” he exclaimed. “A perfect specimen!
Oh, boys, this voyage has started most excellently
for me!”</p>

<p>“It would have been the other kind of a start
if I hadn’t caught you,” observed Ned.</p>

<p>“Thank you, my dear young friend,” spoke the
professor, as he carefully dried the dragon fly and
placed it in his cyanide bottle to kill it painlessly
for preservation. “I appreciate what you did for
me, but I would rather fall overboard a dozen
times than miss this beautiful specimen.”</p>

<p>Jerry started the engine again, and soon the
<i>Dartaway</i> was cutting through the water at a fast
speed. Jerry had asked the advice of some sea
captains in St. Augustine and they had told him to
keep in the Matanzas river instead of standing out
to sea, and, on reaching Matanzas inlet to use that
as a means of getting out on the Atlantic. This
plan was followed, and at noon they emerged on
the ocean, which they greeted with a cheer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here we are again!” cried Ned. “Guess
you haven’t forgotten us, Old Salt Horse! How’s
Father Neptune, anyhow? We had some tussles
with you last year when Salt-Water Sam was
aboard. If he was here he’d sing this song,” and
Ned, hitching his trousers up in true nautical fashion,
delivered himself of this classic which the old
sailor used to sing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“It was on the isle of Nankum,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Near the land of Timbuctoo<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That poor old Sam fell overboard one night.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There was a great commotion<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In the middle of the ocean<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sure he gave the sharks and whales<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A terrible fright.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Good!” cried Bob. “Give us the second
verse.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any second verse.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, the third then. I’m not particular,”
and Bob began to investigate one of the food
lockers.</p>

<p>“Here! Keep out of there until dinner time,”
called Jerry.</p>

<p>“It’s dinner time now. Long past noon,” remarked
Bob.</p>

<p>“Wait until we make that point of land then,
and&mdash;”</p>

<p>What Jerry was going to say he never finished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
for at that instant the <i>Dartaway</i> hit something
with a force that threw Ned, who was standing
up, off his feet and into the bottom of the craft.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Must have hit a rock!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Is the boat sinking? If it is let me put a life
preserver on my specimen boxes!” begged the
professor.</p>

<p>Jerry had instantly shut off the power and was
peering over the bow.</p>

<p>“Don’t seem to be any rock,” he murmured.
“We have deep water here.”</p>

<p>Then, to the surprise of all on board, the <i>Dartaway</i>
began to move through the water at a fast
rate.</p>

<p>“Did you turn on the power?” cried Jerry to
Ned, who was nearest the engine.</p>

<p>“No! The motor isn’t going!”</p>

<p>“But we are!”</p>

<p>The professor looked over the side of the boat.
Then, pointing to something in the water just
ahead, he said:</p>

<p>“We are being towed by a giant turtle!”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>THE PROFESSOR’S TRICK</small></h2>


<p>The boys looked to where the scientist pointed.
Some large shape could be seen just under the surface
of the water, which was being churned into
foam by the action of the creature’s flippers.</p>

<p>“How did that get hold of us?” asked Bob.
“Has it got us in its mouth?”</p>

<p>“The anchor got loose and dangled over the
side,” explained Jerry as he made a hasty examination.
“One of the flukes must have caught under
the turtle’s shell after we rammed it. Now
the creature is carrying us out to sea!”</p>

<p>“Cut the rope!” cried Ned. “He’ll swamp
us!”</p>

<p>“No! No!” shouted Jerry. “We can’t afford
to lose our anchor. We’ll need it later on.”</p>

<p>“But how are we going to get rid of the turtle?”
asked Bob. “He’ll swamp us if he gets us
away out in the rough water.”</p>

<p>The situation was indeed a grave one. The
turtle, doubtless imagining it had the best of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
enemy, was increasing its speed. With the anchor
caught under a forward flipper, where it offered
no impediment to swimming, the big creature
was towing the <i>Dartaway</i> as easily as it might
a piece of driftwood.</p>

<p>“Reverse the engine!” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to do that,” objected Jerry.
“He’s pulling so strong that if we start the motor
on the reverse we may damage the boat.”</p>

<p>“But we’ve got to do something,” put in Bob.</p>

<p>“I have it!” cried Jerry. “I’ll shoot the turtle!”</p>

<p>He made his way to the stern of the craft, where
in a locker the boys had stowed their guns. Jerry
took out his repeating rifle and loaded it. By
this time the boat was well out from shore, close
to which the craft had been kept because the water
was not so rough there.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked the professor.
After his first glimpse of the turtle he
had, apparently, taken no further interest in it, but
was intently watching the gyrations of a swarm of
little gnats that were flying about the boat.</p>

<p>“Going to shoot the turtle,” replied Jerry.
“We can’t get rid of him any other way, and
there’s no telling where he’ll take us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“But you can’t shoot him,” said the scientist,
steadying himself against the rocking of the boat,
which was now among some big rollers.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“In the first place he is so far down under the
water that the bullets would glance off, and never
touch him. And, if by some chance they should
hit him, his shell is thick enough to make them
seem like dried peas.”</p>

<p>“I’ll aim at his head,” proposed Jerry, anxious
to use his rifle on the creature.</p>

<p>“I fancy he has his head well drawn back under
his protecting shell,” Mr. Snodgrass went on.</p>

<p>“Try for a flipper,” put in Ned.</p>

<p>“His flippers are mostly only muscle and cartilage,”
declared the professor. “He wouldn’t
mind a bullet through them any more than you
would if you stuck a pin in the calloused part of
the palm of your hand.”</p>

<p>“Then what can we do?” asked Jerry, who
was beginning to be a little frightened at the prospect
before them. The turtle seemed tireless.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to try a trick,” the scientist announced.
“Have you a fishing rod aboard?”</p>

<p>“Several of them,” replied Jerry. “But do
you think you can catch him on a hook and line?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“Scarcely. But get the longest pole you have,
please. I’ll show you something that I think will
make Mr. Turtle let go of our anchor.”</p>

<p>Wondering what their friend was about to do
the boys watched him select a strong line from
the supply they had brought along. Next the
professor fastened on a large hook, using a strong
wire snell.</p>

<p>“Got any meat aboard,” was the scientist’s
next question.</p>

<p>“Some canned stuff,” replied Bob, who could
be depended on to know what was in the larder.</p>

<p>“That will do. Get me a large firm piece.”</p>

<p>Bob opened some corned beef, and soon the
professor had baited the hook. Then he took
his position in the bow and, with the rod extended
at the end of which dangled the line, hook and
meat, he prepared to put his trick into operation.</p>

<p>Fortunately the rope to which the anchor was
attached had caught on a cleat after paying out a
little as the turtle fouled the fluke. This permitted
the creature to go but a short distance ahead
of the <i>Dartaway</i> which it was towing. Otherwise
the scientist might have been unable to do as he
did.</p>

<p>While the boys watched him Uriah Snodgrass
lowered the bait into the water, just ahead of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
little ripples that indicated where the turtle’s head
was located.</p>

<p>“He’s surely going to try to catch the turtle,”
said Bob in a low voice. “I hope he does. I’ve
heard that turtle soup and steaks are fine eating.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you let up on eating at a time like this?”
demanded Jerry in a sharp whisper.</p>

<p>The professor was leaning forward in an expectant
attitude. It did look as though he hoped
to catch the turtle as one angles after a wary
fish. To a certain extent, that was what happened.
The big creature saw the bait dangling
in front of it. The rush of the water
through which it was gliding swept the meat
nearer. It liked the smell of the canned corned
beef, though probably it was a new item on the
turtle’s bill of fare. At any rate the matter of
towing that troublesome object, which persisted
in following it need not interfere with a meal.
The turtle decided to take the meat.</p>

<p>Just as it was about to grasp the bait in the
horny beak, strong enough to shear through a
man’s foot, the professor, who was on the watch
with sharp eyes, moved it ahead a little, and then
to one side. The turtle doubtless thought the
thing was alive and this made it all the more anxious
to get the food. There was a flurry of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
strong flippers. The turtle turned to one side to
follow the tempting morsel.</p>

<p>Cautiously the professor moved the rod and
bait until he was holding it over the side of the
boat instead of out from the bow. <a href="#image02">The turtle
kept turning to reach the meat</a> which was held just
a few inches beyond its nose.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">

</a><br /><div class="caption"><a href="#Page_48">THE TURTLE KEPT TURNING TO REACH THE MEAT</a></div>
</div>

<p>Suddenly there was a rush in the water and the
pole bent almost double. The reel sent out a
shrill screech.</p>

<p>“I’ve hooked him!” cried the professor.
“He’s free from the rope now! Start the engine,
Jerry!”</p>

<p>Jerry lost no time in doing this. The chug-chug
of the motor was soon heard and the <i>Dartaway</i>
forged ahead, freed from its deep-sea captor.</p>

<p>“Haul up the anchor!” called the professor to
Ned. “We don’t want any more happenings
like that. Bob, put the wheel around and send
us toward shore. It’s too rough out here.”</p>

<p>The three boys were busy attending to the boat,
while the scientist was still holding the tauted
line and the bent pole over the side of the craft.
An instant later there sounded a sharp snap.</p>

<p>“The line’s broken!” cried the professor.
“There goes the turtle!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>He pointed ahead to where a flurry in the water
indicated the presence of the creature. “Well, I
hope he likes his canned beef with hook dressing.
At any rate we’re well rid of him, though I would
liked to have had him for a specimen.”</p>

<p>“That was quite a trick,” observed Jerry, as he
took charge of the steering wheel.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>BOB GETS A SCARE</small></h2>


<p>Professor Snodgrass wound back on the reel
what remained of the line. Then he unjointed
the pole.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he remarked. “I thought that was
about the only way we could make the turtle let
go of the rope. I enticed him around to one side,
and that, naturally, made the rope drop from under
his flipper. We’ll have to be more careful
after this.”</p>

<p>Speeding the motor up, Jerry soon had the boat
near shore, and he directed the course along the
coast in comparatively quiet water.</p>

<p>They came into a small sheltered bay and, in a
little cove where palm trees came down almost to
the water’s edge, forming an ideal spot to rest,
they went ashore.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll take a little walk into the interior
while you boys get dinner,” remarked the professor,
taking his butterfly net and the cyanide bottle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
which he used for painlessly killing insects he
captured.</p>

<p>“Don’t get lost,” advised Ned.</p>

<p>“If you see any orange groves let me know,”
called Bob.</p>

<p>The three boys were soon busy setting up their
portable stove and preparing a meal, using the
canned provisions they had brought along.</p>

<p>“How about fish?” asked Ned. “Looks as
though there ought to be some in this cove.”</p>

<p>“Try your luck,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>Ned got out his tackle and soon was casting in
off a small point of land that stuck out into deep
water. In a little while he had caught several
fine specimens, and they were soon in the frying
pan with some strips of bacon.</p>

<p>“Smells just like a restaurant,” spoke Bob, taking
long breaths.</p>

<p>“It will be better if it tastes like one,” observed
Jerry, who was superintending the cooking.
“I am a little out of practice.”</p>

<p>“Wonder why the professor doesn’t come
back,” remarked Ned, when dinner was ready to
serve. “I think he must be hungry.”</p>

<p>“Probably he is, but he doesn’t know it,” suggested
Bob. “Very likely he’s chasing after a
red, white and blue ant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll go after him,” volunteered Jerry. “You
fellows go on eating. Don’t wait for me.”</p>

<p>He started off in the direction taken by the professor
while Bob, too hungry to stand on ceremony,
began to do ample justice to the food.
Ned joined him, and they were nearly finished before
the scientist and Jerry appeared coming
through the grove of palm trees.</p>

<p>“What’s Jerry got in his arms?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. The professor is laden down
with the same thing, evidently.”</p>

<p>“They’re oranges!” cried Bob, as he caught
sight of the yellow objects. “They’ve found a
grove of orange trees! I wish I’d gone along!”</p>

<p>“Here are some of the specimens the professor
captured,” remarked Jerry with a laugh, and he
placed his fruit on the grass.</p>

<p>“Where do they grow?” asked Bob eagerly,
beginning to extract the juice from a large orange.</p>

<p>“About half a mile back,” Mr. Snodgrass replied.
“I met the owner of the grove and he
invited me to take as many as I wanted.”</p>

<p>After dinner they took up their journey again,
and that night slept on the boat, anchored in a little
harbor about forty miles further down the
coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>They had an early breakfast and after making
some minor adjustments to the engine started off
again. The weather continued pleasant, though
there was quite a swell on, and riding in the boat
was not as comfortable as it had been the previous
day.</p>

<p>“We’ll reach Mosquito Inlet about noon,” announced
Jerry looking at the map in the guide
book.</p>

<p>“Very good,” said the professor.</p>

<p>“I’d say it was very bad,” put in Ned, making
a wry face. “I’m not very fond of mosquitoes.”</p>

<p>“I need a few more specimens to complete my
collection,” the scientist added.</p>

<p>“What is Mosquito Inlet?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“It’s an entrance from the ocean to what is
called Hillsborough river,” replied Jerry. “It’s
really a part of the sea, but the book says it’s a fine
route for boats, and we’ll take it. From there,
by means of the Haulover Canal, we can get right
into Indian river and reach Titusville.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s do it by all means,” suggested
Bob. “This motion is a little too much for
me.”</p>

<p>In fact the rolling and pitching of the <i>Dartaway</i>
under the influence of the ocean swell, was
not very agreeable, and all the travelers were glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
when they reached the inlet and speeded through
it to the quiet waters of Hillsborough River.</p>

<p>They ate lunch aboard without stopping, as it
was low tide, and not easy to go ashore across the
stretch of mud revealed by the receding water.
That evening they emerged into Indian River, a
beautiful stretch of water about one hundred and
fifty miles long, almost as straight as an arrow,
and separated from the sea by a narrow strip of
land. Its waters are salt like the ocean, and it is
affected by the tides.</p>

<p>As dusk settled down the boys found the scene
one of much beauty. On their left they could
catch occasional glimpses of the masts of ocean
vessels sailing close to the coast to avoid the powerful
Gulf stream. On their right was a forest
of palmetto and other trees, forming a sort of
screen for the orange groves beyond.</p>

<p>“It smells just like&mdash;just like&mdash;” and Bob
paused for a comparison.</p>

<p>“Just like a wedding party,” finished Jerry as
he took in deep breaths of the orange-perfumed
air.</p>

<p>The river was widening as they advanced, and
the air was filled with flocks of ducks and geese returning
from their feeding grounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m going to try for some!” exclaimed Bob,
preparing to get out his shot gun.</p>

<p>“Better not to-night,” advised the professor.
“It’s getting dark and you couldn’t see to pick
them up if they fell into the water.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have some to-morrow,” declared Bob.
“I’m very fond of roast duck.”</p>

<p>It seemed to grow dark suddenly with the quickness
that is always noticed in southern countries.
Ned, who had taken his place at the steering
wheel, looked down at the water and gave a startled
cry.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“It’s on fire!” exclaimed Bob, as he glanced
over the side.</p>

<p>Indeed it did seem as though the river was
ablaze. For a space of a hundred feet or more
ahead of the bow, and on either side, there were
long lines and streamers of fire, crossed and recrossed
as though some giant lace-making machine
was weaving a pattern in colors of glowing,
golden yellow.</p>

<p>“A beautiful display of the phosphorescent
qualities of this stream,” observed the professor.
“Very beautiful. It is caused by the fish swimming
about,” the scientist explained. “They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
agitate the water, which possesses suspended in it
a quantity of phosphorous and when it is disturbed
it seems to glow like fire. I have often
read about it, but I have seldom witnessed it. It
is almost light enough to see to catch specimens
by.”</p>

<p>“The guide book speaks of it,” said Jerry.
“I ought to have known what it was. But I
guess we’d better think of camping. We can’t
go any farther to-night.”</p>

<p>Lanterns were lighted, and with the searchlight
glowing in the bow, to enable them to select a
good place to land, the boat was sent toward
shore. All the way there they seemed to be moving
through a river of fire.</p>

<p>They found a good landing place, and soon
had their camp arranged for the night. It was
decided to sleep ashore as it was somewhat
crowded on board. Accordingly, mosquito canopies
were arranged, and after supper the boys prepared
their beds under a shelter tent which was
erected.</p>

<p>“I’m going to make me a mattress,” said Bob,
as, carrying a lantern, he went down to the edge
of the river.</p>

<p>“What of; Spanish moss?” asked Ned.
“I’ve read there’s lots of that in Florida.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“That would be fine,” replied Chunky. “But
I don’t see any around. No, I’m going to make
it of grass.”</p>

<p>He proceeded to pull a lot of long bladed herbage
from the bank of the river, and soon had
himself a soft nest under the shelter of the tent.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll beat you all at sleeping to-night,”
said Bob, as he stretched out in his clothes on the
grass. The others had wrapped themselves up in
their blankets.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” murmured Ned. “I’m satisfied
with what I’ve got. I could sleep on a bare
plank.”</p>

<p>Soon deep breathing told that all the occupants
of the camp were far off in slumber-land. It was
after midnight when all the others were suddenly
aroused by a series of frightened yells from Bob.</p>

<p>“Something’s got me! It’s got hold of my
foot! It’s dragging me to the river!” he cried.</p>

<p>Ned and Jerry leaped to their feet. Jerry
grabbed his gun which was near him on the
ground. The professor snatched down the lantern
from a pole in front of the tent and flashed
it in Bob’s direction.</p>

<p>“It’s an alligator!” yelled Ned, pointing to
some big black object. “Fire, Jerry!”</p>

<p>Jerry raised his rifle, but, as he did so Bob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
pulled his foot away from whatever creature had
hold of him and ran toward his companions who
had gathered in a group some distance from the
tent.</p>

<p>“Shoot it! It tried to eat me up!” he yelled.</p>

<p>Jerry fired point blank, but he evidently missed
for the black object, dimly seen in the shadows
cast by the lantern seemed to flop away. An instant
later a loud splash told that it had entered
the river.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>KILLING A MANATEE</small></h2>


<p>“What was it?” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Bob, who was almost
too frightened to speak. “I was dreaming
one of you fellows was pulling me from bed by my
foot and I woke up to discover that some animal
had me. I looked and saw something black!
Then I yelled.”</p>

<p>“Let’s make an examination,” suggested the
professor. “Is your foot much hurt?”</p>

<p>“A little,” admitted Bob.</p>

<p>But an investigation showed that though his
shoe was dented as if by the marks of broad teeth,
the leather had not been penetrated, and, on taking
off his shoe, Bob found his foot was only
bruised.</p>

<p>“There are the tracks of where the beast came
from the river,” said Jerry, pointing to the unmistakable
path of some large animal. It had come
up the river bank, straight to the bed Bob had so
carefully made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“Must have been a crocodile,” insisted Ned.</p>

<p>“There aren’t any in Florida,” said the professor.
“The alligators are not found in this region,
either. Whatever it was Bob, you baited it
yourself.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Why, when you pulled that grass you left a
long trail of it from the river bank right to the
tent. The creature simply followed it up, eating
as it went, and when it struck your bunk I suppose
it thought it had quite a feast. I guess the
taking hold of your foot was only accidental.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it was a sort of walking fish,” suggested
Jerry.</p>

<p>“I have an idea what it was,” the professor answered.</p>

<p>“A snake?” asked Bob, and he turned paler
than before.</p>

<p>“No, not a snake. I’ll tell you in the morning.
Better go to bed now. We’ll light several
more lanterns and I think they will keep away any
other creatures.”</p>

<p>Bob declared he had had enough of his grass
bed, so he got some blankets from the boat and
stretched out under the tent between Ned and
Jerry, and as far as possible from the river.</p>

<p>“Whatever it was, it’s not going to nab me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
again,” he said, as he fell into an uneasy slumber.</p>

<p>There were no further disturbances that night,
and in the morning the boys gazed curiously at the
broad path made by Bob’s midnight visitor.</p>

<p>“Looks as though it was as big as a cow,” said
Jerry as he saw the marks.</p>

<p>“Maybe it was,” remarked the professor.</p>

<p>“Don’t see what cows would be doing in the
river,” observed Ned, but Mr. Snodgrass only
smiled.</p>

<p>“What’s the program this morning?” asked
Bob after breakfast had been disposed of and the
things packed back into the boat. “Where are
we going, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Let’s keep right on down this river,” suggested
Ned. “It’s a fine place.”</p>

<p>“Not for me!” exclaimed Bob. “At least if
we do I’m going to sleep on the boat. No more
cows for mine.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to Titusville,” declared Jerry.
“Of course it would be nice to voyage down this
river, and, according to my guide book it’s a beautiful
sail. But if we want to get to Lake Okeechobee
we’ll have to change to rail transportation
for a while and embark again on Lake Tohopekaliga.”</p>

<p>“I guess that will suit me as well,” the professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
announced. “I must soon begin to look for
that rare butterfly. It is found in the region of
the lakes, and I may be fortunate enough to run
across a specimen very soon.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to know it when you see
it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“By its color, for one thing. It is pink, and
has blue and gold wings. Then it feeds in a peculiar
manner. It spreads its wings out when taking
nectar from a flower, and is frequently mistaken
for a blossom. I hope I shall find several
such butterflies.”</p>

<p>“We’ll help you look for them,” offered Jerry,
as he started the boat.</p>

<p>It was but a short run from the head of the Indian
river, where the travelers had entered, to Titusville,
and, in order to enjoy the unusual scenery,
Jerry ran the craft at slow speed. The boys
watched the river as it stretched out before them,
now narrowing and again widening, while they
puffed slowly past groves of palmetto trees that
the orange growers depended on as a screen for
their groves, which might otherwise be frosted by
the cold winds from the Atlantic.</p>

<p>“Can’t we go ashore and get some fruit?”
asked Bob, when they had traveled some miles.</p>

<p>“I guess the owners would have no objection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
if we took some,” said the professor. “I understand
they always invite visitors to help themselves.”</p>

<p>The boys decided to act on this suggestion, and
soon the boat was anchored at the shore and the
four voyagers went inland until they found an orange
grove. They met an overseer who invited
them to gather all they could eat.</p>

<p>“These are much better than the others we
had,” spoke Bob, biting into a luscious fruit.</p>

<p>“He’s getting to be quite an expert,” declared
Jerry.</p>

<p>Once more they boarded the boat and Jerry put
it well out toward the middle of the river which
was very broad at this point.</p>

<p>“There, I guess I’ve had all the juice there is
in that orange!” exclaimed Bob, as he tossed the
mass of skin and pulp overboard. “Hand me
another, Ned.”</p>

<p>As the orange which Bob threw away struck
the water, there was a sudden rush as though some
large creature had grabbed the pulp.</p>

<p>“What was that?” cried Bob, as he saw
some big object swimming just beneath the surface.</p>

<p>“Made enough fuss for a whale or shark,” observed
Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was after the orange, but I guess it didn’t
like it, for it didn’t eat it.”</p>

<p>“Throw another in,” suggested the professor.
“We’ll see what it is.”</p>

<p>Jerry tossed some fruit overboard. There was
a swirl in the river, and a mass of foam, just ahead
of the <i>Dartaway</i>. The creature seemed to inspect
the floating oranges, and then ignore them.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Ned suddenly. “It’s coming
this way, Jerry!”</p>

<p>Jerry saw something approaching the craft.
He whirled the wheel over, and speeded up the engine,
just in time to avoid whatever it was.</p>

<p>“That’s an ugly beast,” remarked Bob.
“Mad, I guess, because we didn’t give it something
it liked to eat.”</p>

<p>“Here it comes again!” yelled Ned, and this
time the boys saw the creature, just under the surface
of the water, approaching the boat on the
port side.</p>

<p>“He’s going to hit us!” yelled Bob. “Look
out, Jerry!”</p>

<p>Jerry gave a glance over his shoulder. He saw
the mass of water piled up in front of the on-rushing
creature. He increased the speed of the boat,
and endeavored to steer it out of the path of the
animal, whatever it was. But the creature was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
not going to let the boat escape. It changed its
course, and, an instant later, the <i>Dartaway</i> careened
under a violent shock.</p>

<p>There was a splash, as of some heavy object
striking the water.</p>

<p>“Bob’s overboard!” yelled Ned, throwing his
chum a cork ring, attached to a rope. “He’s going
to ram us again, Jerry!”</p>

<p>There was great confusion on the <i>Dartaway</i>.
Jerry had reversed the engine, and was looking
about to catch sight of Bob, who was floundering
around in the water.</p>

<p>“There it comes!” shouted Ned.</p>

<p>Once more the creature was returning to the attack.
But this time it did not strike the boat.
The reversing of the engine had brought the craft
to a stop, and it was beginning to go astern. This
caused the creature to shoot just across the bows.</p>

<p>“It’s a seal!” yelled Jerry, who caught a passing
glimpse of a big brown body just under the
water. “Hand me a gun and I’ll shoot it!”</p>

<p>By this time Bob had grasped the cork ring,
and the professor, who had hold of the rope, was
pulling the boy aboard. Ned reached a rifle
from the locker and passed it to Jerry, who had
shut off the power so he would not have to steer
the boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can you see it?” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“He’s coming at us again,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“Shoot it in the head!” called the professor,
not desisting from his work of rescuing Bob.</p>

<p>“You take a gun, Ned!” shouted Jerry. “I
may miss!”</p>

<p>Ned secured another weapon, and hurried to
the bow to stand beside his chum. Both boys
could see where the creature was by reason of the
disturbance in the water.</p>

<p>“I see its head!” spoke Ned in a whisper.
“It’s just like a seal.”</p>

<p>He took as careful aim as he could, as also did
Jerry. The two rifles were discharged together,
and as the bullets struck the water they sent up
little jets of spray. Then followed a great commotion,
and the river in that vicinity was churned
to foam.</p>

<p>“We must have hit him!” yelled Jerry.</p>

<p>“We sure did!” added Ned. “The water is
red!”</p>

<p>The crimson color was spreading over the surface.
<a href="#image01">The creature was lashing about</a> evidently
<a href="#image01">in a death struggle.</a></p>

<p>“Once more!” cried Ned, as he worked the
lever of his repeating rifle, and Jerry followed
his example. They fired again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>This time they could hear the thud of the bullets
as they struck. There was a cessation of the
beast’s struggles, and the water grew quieter.</p>

<p>“Guess that finished him,” observed Jerry,
peering forward. “He’s done for.”</p>

<p>“What was it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Give me a hand here!” called the professor.
“I want to lift Bob in.”</p>

<p>The two marksmen turned from their inspection
of the thing in the water at the bow of the
<i>Dartaway</i> to assist in getting their chum aboard.</p>

<p>“Did you think you needed a bath, Chunky?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I got&mdash;one&mdash;whether&mdash;I needed it&mdash;or&mdash;or
not,” spluttered Bob, as he got rid of
the water in his eyes, nose, ears and mouth.
“Give me a hand.”</p>

<p>They helped him into the boat, dripping wet,
but otherwise uninjured, as Bob was fat, and
floated well, in spite of the handicap of his clothes.</p>

<p>“What was it, a whale?” asked the wet one.
“Did he put a hole in the boat?”</p>

<p>“Guess we’re not much damaged,” replied Jerry.
“But I haven’t yet seen what the thing was,
unless it’s a seal.”</p>

<p>“There it is,” observed Mr. Snodgrass, as he
pointed to a big brown object floating on the water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
“It’s a manatee or sea-cow. I didn’t expect
to meet with any, as they are almost gone
from this part of the world.”</p>

<p>“A manatee!” exclaimed Bob, in consternation.
“It’s a good thing I didn’t try to bring one
to Andy Rush!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>A MISFORTUNE</small></h2>


<p>Jerry started the engine, and, at slow speed,
put the boat close over to the big creature, which
was now quite dead.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t any idea they were so large,” said
Ned.</p>

<p>“As I told you before, they sometimes weigh
nearly a thousand pounds,” the professor said.
“They are harmless, but I suppose this one must
be an old one, and a sort of king of this section of
the river. Very likely he didn’t like our boat to
disturb his feeding ground. By the way, Bob, I
think he’s a friend of yours.”</p>

<p>“A friend of mine?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that one, or one just like it, tried to bite
your foot last night.”</p>

<p>“Was that what had hold of my foot?”</p>

<p>“That was the creature,” replied the scientist.
“I was pretty sure of it before, but I didn’t want
to say so until I had some proof. I had no idea
there were any in this river, and I fancy we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
see no more. Well, boys, you had quite an experience.
Many hunters would give a good deal
for the chance of killing a manatee, though I don’t
see much sport in it myself.”</p>

<p>“What are they good for?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Various purposes. I suppose some years ago
the Seminole Indians were very glad to eat them.
But I don’t believe we’ll take it along with us. It
would be too much trouble. If it was alive a museum
might pay a good price for it. But, Bob, I
hope you’re not in danger of taking cold from
your bath.”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” replied Chunky with a
laugh. “It’s so warm in the water that I’d like
to stay in all day.”</p>

<p>They helped him wring out his clothes and they
were hung up to dry, while he donned some spare
garments.</p>

<p>“Now for Titusville!” cried Jerry, as he
speeded up the motor.</p>

<p>They reached the city about noon, and as they
wanted to get the boat ready for another overland
journey they decided to have dinner on board
before going ashore to make their arrangements.</p>

<p>When they got to the freight office they found
that the cradle, in which the <i>Dartaway</i> was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
shipped, had arrived. They engaged men to get
the boat from the water, and, having seen it safely
put on a flat car for shipment, they bought their
tickets for Kissimmee City, where they were again
to begin water travel.</p>

<p>Though the railway journey was interesting, and
gave the boys glimpses of persons and scenery
they were unfamiliar with, they were anxious for
it to be over so they might again feel the throb of
the <i>Dartaway’s</i> engine.</p>

<p>Owing to a wreck on the road they missed connections
and they had to lay over one night at a
small village. The next day travel was slow,
and they did not reach Kissimmee City until nightfall.</p>

<p>“I hope our boat’s here,” said Jerry as he got
off the train. “These railroads don’t have
enough travel to make them as fast as those in
the north.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it was in the freight wreck that delayed
us,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“There you go, Old Calamity Howler!” exclaimed
Ned. “What do you want to go suggesting
any such thing as that for?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean anything,” responded Bob,
rather surprised at Ned’s explosion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“I was just thinking the same thing myself,”
Ned went, “and I didn’t want my bad presentment
to be seconded.”</p>

<p>“You fellows are talking nonsense,” spoke Jerry.
“Come on until we find a hotel. Then I’ll
inquire about the boat. But where is the professor?”</p>

<p>“He was here a moment ago,” replied Ned.</p>

<p>“There he is,” said Bob, pointing to the figure
of the scientist. Mr. Snodgrass was on his hands
and knees on the depot platform, while near him,
in the glare of a lamp, stood a small crowd.</p>

<p>“Is he hurt?” asked Bob, in some alarm.</p>

<p>“More likely he’s trying to catch a new specimen
of a hop-toad,” was Jerry’s idea.</p>

<p>As the boys approached the professor they saw
he had in his hand a small net with which he was
endeavoring to capture something.</p>

<p>“Did yo’ lose anything, stranger?” asked a
tall langy southerner, as he observed the professor.
“If yo’ did, say the word and we’ll all jine
in an’ help yo’ look for it, suah!”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied the scientist, not looking
up from his occupation. “I just saw a very rare
specimen of a red flea, and I want to catch it for
my collection.”</p>

<p>“A flea!” exclaimed the southerner, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
others in the crowd looked as though they thought
the professor had gone crazy.</p>

<p>“Yes, a beautiful red flea, and very rare.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, stranger,” went on the man who
had first spoken, “no offense, yo’ understand, but
if yo’ want about seven million of them fleas I
reckon we can accommodate yo’. I’ve got a dog
that’d give a good bit to git rid of ’em, an’ I
reckon as how some others I know can supply yo’.
Take ’em all, an’ welcome, but don’t turn ’em
loose again in Kissimmee City.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied the scientist, as though
some one had presented him with a large sum of
money. “I only require one or two. The kind
I seek is not as common as you think. There!
I have him,” and he made a sudden movement
with the tiny net, imprisoning the hopping red captive.</p>

<p>“All kinds of fleas is too common around
heah,” observed the tall man.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” chorused his companions.</p>

<p>But the professor was intent only on his captive.
He carefully placed it in a bottle and then
turned to look for the boys. He had been oblivious
to everything, save the red flea, since he
had first seen the creature.</p>

<p>The travelers found a hotel and, after arranging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
for their rooms, the three boys decided to visit
the freight station and inquire about the <i>Dartaway</i>.</p>

<p>They found the office deserted, and, after tramping
about the platform, and calling out in vain for
some one of whom they might make inquiries,
they saw, approaching, a little colored boy.</p>

<p>“Wuz yo’ uns a-lookin’ fer any one?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Where’s the freight agent?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s over to Buck Johnson’s.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Johnson’s?”</p>

<p>“Down the road, about two hoots an’ a holler.”</p>

<p>“How far is that?” asked Ned, to whom this
description of distance was new.</p>

<p>“I doan’t rightly know, but ef yo’ go twice as
fur as yo’ kin hoot, an’ then as fur as yo’ kin holler,
yo’ll find him, but I don’t guess he’ll come.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“’Cause he’s at a dorg fight, an’ he hates t’
come away from a dorg fight.”</p>

<p>“Can you tell him we’d like to see him about
our boat?” inquired Jerry, holding up a shining
quarter.</p>

<p>“Mister, I’d go fo’ miles fer two bits,” replied
the little darky, calling the twenty-five cent piece
by its southern name. He seized the money as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
though he feared it would vanish, and started off
on a run.</p>

<p>Whether “two hoots and a holler” was only
a short distance, or whether the freight agent hurried
away from the dog fight because of the small
negro’s description of the three travelers who were
so lavish with “two-bit pieces” was not disclosed.
At any rate a man was soon seen slouching down
the platform.</p>

<p>“Was yo’-uns lookin’ fer me?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Are you the freight agent?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s what I be. I’m here nights, but Jim
Peterson is here day times. We don’t do much
business nights, an’ I jest took an hour or so off&mdash;er&mdash;fer
amusement,” he added. “We was
havin’ a sort of athletic contest. What kin I do
fer yo’? Was yo’ expectin’ some freight?”</p>

<p>Jerry smiled at the man’s idea of an athletic
contest in conjunction with a dog fight, and answered:</p>

<p>“We’re expecting a motor boat, shipped from
Titusville.”</p>

<p>“A motor boat?”</p>

<p>“It’s called the <i>Dartaway</i>,” added Ned, to
help the agent’s memory.</p>

<p>“A boat, eh?” and he seemed provokingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
slow. “Well, now, I’m terrible sorry to disappoint
yo’ gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t it come?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“No, an’ guess it won’t,” said the agent in
drawling tones. “I got word last night that
some boat that was comin’ heah was all busted to
pieces in a freight wreck!”</p>

<p>“The <i>Dartaway</i> smashed!” exclaimed Jerry,
and the hearts of all the lads sank at the news of
such a misfortune.</p>

<small>NEWS OF NODDY</small></h2>


<p>For several seconds no one spoke. The boys
stood staring at one another and the agent started
to go away, evidently believing he had done his
part.</p>

<p>“Can you give us any particulars?” asked
Jerry at last. “Where is the boat? Perhaps we
can have it fixed.”</p>

<p>“It’s at Longwood, about ten miles from here,”
the agent replied, “but there’s no trains to-night.
Yo’-uns will have to wait until mornin’.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never sleep a wink,” declared Ned.
“Think of the <i>Dartaway</i> being smashed!” And
he gave something like a groan.</p>

<p>“If she is smashed the railroad company will
have to pay heavy damages,” declared Jerry.
“They’ve spoiled our whole vacation trip! Can’t
you give us any particulars?” he went on, turning
to the agent. “Maybe we could hire a carriage
and drive to Longwood. We’ve got to find out
something about our boat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I guess yo’ could drive there,” the agent
replied. “But I wouldn’t advise yo’ to, after
dark. The roads are bad and dangerous. Why
can’t yo’ wait until mornin’?”</p>

<p>“We’re too anxious,” declared Bob.</p>

<p>“Can’t we telegraph?” inquired Ned.</p>

<p>“The telegraph office is closed after supper,”
announced the agent, and, with their last hope
gone, of getting any particulars that night, the
boys turned away. They went back to the hotel.</p>

<p>“We’ll tell the professor,” said Bob. “Maybe
he can help us out.”</p>

<p>When the scientist was made acquainted with
the news he was much surprised.</p>

<p>“That spoils my plan of catching the prize butterfly,”
he remarked. “I’ve got to make other
arrangements.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever have anything lost by a railroad?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Once.”</p>

<p>“Was it smashed?”</p>

<p>“Partly.”</p>

<p>“What did you do to find it and get it back?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the railroad company was glad enough to
assist me,” answered the scientist.</p>

<p>“How?” inquired Jerry, and the boys looked
interested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why I once shipped a case of very valuable
white rats,” Mr. Snodgrass went on. “It was in
a wreck, or something, and the railroad lost track
of the case; I couldn’t get trace of it. But in a
little while I received urgent letters calling on me
to take my white rats away. It seems the case
had been side tracked after the accident and sent
to a lonely station where the agent was a woman.
The rats got loose and frightened her almost to
death. She wired to headquarters threatening to
resign unless the rats were taken away. In that
way the claim agent heard&mdash;”</p>

<p>But what the professor was going to say he
never finished, for, at that moment some kind of a
bug came flying into the room through the opened
window, and the scientist was after it at once.
With his long-handled net in his hand he pursued
the insect about the room.</p>

<p>“Now I have it!” Mr. Snodgrass cried as the
bug alighted on the upper part of the door. He
was bringing his upraised net down to catch it
when the portal opened and a colored man entered,
bearing a pitcher of ice water. His head
came just in the right place and an instant later the
professor had brought his net down on the woolly
pate of the negro.</p>

<p>The startled colored man dropped the pitcher of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
water, which splashed all over himself and the
professor, and then the darky let out a yell.</p>

<p>“I’m cotched! He’s got me in de net! I’m
a gone coon! Leggo! I ain’t done nuffin! It
were Sam Johnson as done it! Please, good Mr.
Man let me go!”</p>

<p>He struggled to get the net off his head, and the
professor endeavored to assist him, but their efforts
only seemed to make the mosquito-fabric
cling the tighter, until the yells of the colored man
brought several guests out into the corridor on the
run, thinking the hotel might be afire.</p>

<p>“Help ’em, Ned!” called Jerry, who was
laughing so he could not go to the aid of the two.</p>

<p>“Help ’em yourself,” responded Ned, almost
doubled up with mirth at the sight of the struggling
figures.</p>

<p>At length the two managed to extricate themselves,
and the professor, taking his net from the
colored man’s head, carefully examined it for possible
rents.</p>

<p>“Did I hurt you?” asked the scientist.</p>

<p>“No, I cain’t ’zactly say as how ’yo hurted
me,” the colored man replied with a grin, “but yo’
done mos’ scaired me t’ def!”</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry,” went on Mr. Snodgrass.
“I was after a bug!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought yo’ were after me!” and the bearer
of the ice water gazed at the broken pitcher.</p>

<p>“Well, here’s something to buy salve for your
head,” and the professor gave the man a half
dollar.</p>

<p>“Landy! Fo’ bits!” exclaimed the delighted
negro.</p>

<p>None of the boys slept well that night, on account
of thinking about their boat. All hoped
against hope that it might not be so badly damaged
but what it could be repaired.</p>

<p>They paid an early visit to the railroad office,
the professor going with them. Mr. Snodgrass,
in spite of his scientific training, knew how to talk
business, and he soon had the agent wiring for particulars
concerning the motor boat.</p>

<p>“Tell ’em to send it here, no matter how badly
it’s smashed,” put in Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, we want our boat,” added Bob.</p>

<p>“In a hurry,” was Ned’s contribution to the
general orders.</p>

<p>“My, but yo’ folks from the North are in a
powerful rush,” observed the agent with a smile.
“We-uns down here take life easier. I’ll do my
best for yo’. The night man left word that yo’
uns was frettin’ an’ stewin’ about yo’ boat. Yo’
uns is jest like another feller from the North.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
He was here a while ago, an’ he were raisin’ Hail
Columbia ’cause the train was behind time. Said
he were goin’ to his cocoanut plantation near
Lake Okeechobee an’ wanted to git there in a
hurry.”</p>

<p>“Cocoanut plantation?” asked Jerry, a sudden
idea coming into his brain.</p>

<p>“Yep; that’s what he said. Looked rather
young to be ownin’ a plantation. He was about
the age of yo’ lads. Seemed to think a good deal
of himself, an’ give a powerful lot of orders.”</p>

<p>“What was his name?” asked Ned eagerly.</p>

<p>“Let’s see, now. It was a curious sort of
name. Shaky&mdash;no, it wasn’t Shaky&mdash;Sleepy&mdash;no,
that ain’t it either&mdash;Noddy&mdash;that’s what
it was. Noddy Nixon!”</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon down here!” cried Jerry.
“How long ago?”</p>

<p>“He was at this station a week ago to-day,”
replied the agent. “Had to stay over one night
because he missed a train, and he tried to make
out it was my fault.”</p>

<p>“Just like Noddy,” murmured Ned. “So
he’s down here? Maybe we’ll meet him.”</p>

<p>“Hope not,” remarked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Hark!” exclaimed the agent, as he listened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
to the clicking of the telegraph instrument.
“There’s a message from Longwood. It’s about
you’ boat.”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>AFLOAT ONCE MORE</small></h2>


<p>How the boys wished they understood the mysterious
clicking of dots and dashes that came over
the wires, so they might interpret the message
which meant so much to them! They watched
the agent as he wrote down the words that he
evolved from the sounds of the clicking instrument.
Then, with what the boys thought was
exasperating coolness, he clicked back something
in answer, and slowly arose from his chair.</p>

<p>“Good news,” he said. “It wasn’t your boat
that was smashed. It was some rowboats being
sent to a steamship company on Lake Okeechobee.
Your boat was in the wreck, but was only
scratched a bit. It will be here this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” yelled Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s the kind of news we like to hear!”
exploded Ned.</p>

<p>“What a relief!” ejaculated Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, yo’ uns seem quite pleased,” remarked
the agent. “Can I do anything else for yo’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ve done more than enough, in locating
our boat,” said Jerry. “Is it on the way now?”</p>

<p>“The agent at Longwood says they’re making
up a freight train now to send here. It’s due
shortly after one o’clock. Queer how things will
get mixed up sometimes when there’s a wreck.
I’m glad it wasn’t yo’ boat. But yo’ Northerners
are always in such a hurry! By the way,
was that Noddy fellow any relation of yours?”</p>

<p>“We know him,” answered Jerry.</p>

<p>“I reckoned yo’ uns must have, ’cause he was
in the same kind of a rush,” the agent explained,
as if proud of his discernment.</p>

<p>The boys went back to the hotel for breakfast,
which even Bob had forgone in order to get
earlier news of the boat. Now, with feelings
greatly relieved, they ate the morning meal.</p>

<p>“We might as well arrange for some one to
cart the boat to the lake,” suggested Jerry as they
arose from the table.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better look for a shop where we
can have it repaired,” put in Ned. “It may need
a lot of attention.”</p>

<p>“Hope not,” spoke Jerry, though he thought
Ned’s idea a good one.</p>

<p>They found near the shores of Lake Tohopekaliga
a boat builder, who agreed to take charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of the <i>Dartaway</i>, do whatever was necessary and
transport it to the water for them. Then there
was nothing to do but to wait.</p>

<p>It seemed a long time until noon, and from
then until one o’clock, when the freight was due,
the boys thought the clocks had all gone on a
strike. But at length, as they waited on the
depot platform, they heard a shrill whistle.</p>

<p>“There she comes!” cried Ned. “Now to
learn the worst.”</p>

<p>“Or the best,” remarked Jerry, who was of a
more hopeful turn of mind.</p>

<p>“I see it!” exclaimed Bob, as the freight
train passed them to draw up to the long platform.
“Doesn’t seem to be in such bad shape!”</p>

<p>The formalities of paying the freight and getting
possession of the craft was soon over. The
cradle was left at the depot in readiness for their
return after cruising about Lake Okeechobee,
and the motor boat was taken on a truck to the
repair shop.</p>

<p>Carpenters were soon busy on the craft, and,
though the boys were anxious to get her into the
water they had to wait over another night. This
made them rather impatient but it just suited the
professor, who found many more forms of insect
life than he had anticipated, and he was kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
busy capturing them, much to the astonishment
of the citizens of the place, who voted him almost,
if not completely, insane.</p>

<p>By the second morning of their stay in Kissimmee
City the <i>Dartaway</i> was ready to be put into
the water.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! She’s afloat once more!” cried
Ned, as he saw their craft moored at the lake
dock.</p>

<p>They waited until noon to allow the seams to
soak up, and then, having taken on some fresh
provisions, and succeeded in coaxing the professor
from his search after a peculiar pink
fly he had heard infested the region, they were
off.</p>

<p>It did not take them long to traverse Lake
Tohopekaliga, which is a small body of water.
They caught some fine fish in it, and had dinner
on shore. Through an artificial canal they
reached Lake Hatchenana, and, crossing that,
and again traversing a canal they emerged, late
that afternoon, upon Lake Kissimmee, the largest
body of water between them and Lake Okeechobee.</p>

<p>“This beats railroad travel,” announced Ned,
as he sat in the bows, steering. “No dust, no
cinders, no smoke, no&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“No smash-ups!” finished Bob. “We were
lucky to get out of it as we did.”</p>

<p>“What’s the program for to-night?” asked
the professor of Jerry, who had, in a measure,
assumed charge of the trip.</p>

<p>“There’s an island in the middle of this lake,”
he answered. “I was thinking we might camp
on it.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to put up a net to prevent the
manatees from getting at me,” announced Bob
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“No danger of them here,” spoke the professor.
“But I think we’ll need a net to keep away
the gnats and mosquitoes.”</p>

<p>This proved a correct surmise. When they
landed on the island in the lake, which piece of
land, as far as they could see, was deserted, they
were met with a swarm of winged pests that made
life miserable.</p>

<p>“This is awful!” exclaimed Bob, slapping
about with both hands at the cloud of insects
about his head.</p>

<p>“I think I can do something to make it more
bearable,” Uriah Snodgrass announced, as he began
to delve among his possessions. “Here is
a chemical preparation, which, if you rub it on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
your hands and faces, will, I think, keep the
mosquitoes and black flies away.”</p>

<p>The boys gladly availed themselves of the stuff,
and, after generous applications, they found, that
though the insects still hovered about them, they
were not bitten.</p>

<p>Preparations for supper were hastily made, and
a fire built in the portable stove. A “smudge”
was also made, to keep off most of the mosquitoes
and, after this, the travelers were more
comfortable.</p>

<p>“It’s warm enough to sleep in the open to-night,”
announced Jerry when the question of
erecting the tent was raised. “No use getting
it out, and we can start off so much earlier in the
morning if we don’t have it to bother with.”</p>

<p>The other boys were willing, so, after lighting
some lanterns, and clearing a place amid a
clump of trees, the sleeping blankets were spread
out there and the boys turned in.</p>

<p>The professor, as usual, remained up to arrange
the specimens he had collected during the
day, making entries in his book by the light of a
lantern suspended over a butter tub which he
used as a table. He was still at this when the
boys fell asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned was dreaming that he was in swimming
and that Bob and Jerry was splashing water on
him, when he awoke with a start, to find he was
soaking wet. It was pitch dark, and Ned, at
first, did not know what to make of it. It seemed
as if some one was dashing a pail of water over
him as he lay on the ground.</p>

<p>“Here! Let up!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry, awaking
at the same time. Then Bob added his inquiry,
and the professor, who had retired at midnight,
called to the boys.</p>

<p>“It’s raining cats and dogs!” cried Ned,
scrambling to his feet. “I’m wet through. The
lanterns are drowned out! We should have put
up the tent!”</p>

<p>“Raining!” exclaimed Jerry. “I guess it’s
a cloud-burst from the way I’m getting it!”</p>

<p>It was a drenching downpour, but otherwise
the storm was not violent. It had begun to
shower gently and from that had rapidly increased
to a torrent of water dripping from the clouds.</p>

<p>“Light a lantern somebody!” called Ned.
“Let’s make for the boat! We can keep dry
there!”</p>

<p>“My matches are all wet!” announced Jerry.</p>

<p>“So are mine!” added Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have some dry ones!” the scientist called.
“Wait a minute!”</p>

<p>They could hear him moving about in the
darkness and rain, seeking for a sheltered place
in which to strike a light. Suddenly the blackness
was illuminated by a brilliant white glare.
It shone full in the faces of the travelers, who,
much startled, turned to see what it was. They
heard some object strike the island near where
their boat was moored, and then the light went
out, making the blackness more intense than
before.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>THE HOUSEBOAT</small></h2>


<p>“Lightning!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Must have struck here!” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see lightning so near at hand
and not hear thunder?” asked Jerry. “It was
a searchlight, I think.”</p>

<p>“A searchlight in this deserted region?” inquired
Ned. “Guess again, Jerry.”</p>

<p>No sooner had he spoken than there came the
intense white glare again. This time there was
no mistaking it. It was the flare of an acetylene
gas lantern.</p>

<p>“An automobile!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“On the lake?” asked Ned. Then suddenly
changing the subject; “Wow! I wish I had an
umbrella for a few minutes!” He felt a stream
of water running down his back.</p>

<p>The white shaft of light played about, now on
the trees, now on the water, and again full into
the faces of the bewildered travelers, who stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
in the downpour, not knowing what to do. Then,
from out of the darkness behind the shaft of illumination
were heard the clear tones of a girl’s
voice calling:</p>

<p>“Well, dad, we’ve struck land at any rate!”</p>

<p>“It’s a boat!” exclaimed Jerry. “Somebody
has landed here in a boat!”</p>

<p>“Girls and women in it,” added Ned, as sounds
of several feminine voices were noted. A moment
later a man’s tones asked:</p>

<p>“What sort of land have we struck, Rose?”</p>

<p>“Can’t tell, dad,” was the reply. “It’s solid
enough at any rate, judging by the way the <i>Wanderer</i>
hit it. The searchlight doesn’t show anything
but trees, does it Ponto?”</p>

<p>“No, indeedy,” replied a negro. “But, ’scuse
me, Miss Rose, I done thought I seed some pursons
a minute ago when I done flashed de lantern
straight ahead.”</p>

<p>“Persons, Ponto? Then for mercy sakes,
flash it that way again, and perhaps they’ll tell us
where we are.”</p>

<p>Once more the searchlight shone in the faces
of the boys and the professor, and this time the
girl, who had been speaking to the negro, saw the
travelers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can you tell us where we are?” she called,
raising her voice to be heard above the roar of the
storm.</p>

<p>“On an island in Lake Kissimmee,” replied
Jerry. “What boat is that?”</p>

<p>“The houseboat <i>Wanderer</i>.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Rose?” called another girl’s voice
from somewhere in the darkness back of the
lantern.</p>

<p>“Some boys and a man,” replied Rose.</p>

<p>“Girls! Girls!” exclaimed the voice of the
gentleman aboard the <i>Wanderer</i>. “Stop that
chattering! If there are persons out in the rain
why don’t you ask them to come aboard out of
the storm? Ponto, run out the gangplank!”</p>

<p>“Yas, sah, right away, sah!”</p>

<p>There was a creaking of ropes and the rumble
of a plank being hauled across the deck.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” spoke the one who had been
called Rose, addressing the three boys and the
professor. “Won’t you come aboard out of the
wet?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I believe we will,” answered
Jerry, and, as the plank which the negro thrust
out touched the bank Jerry stepped on it, followed
by his chums and Mr. Snodgrass. A moment
later they were under the shelter of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
houseboat, standing at the entrance to a snug little
cabin, in which were three young ladies and an
elderly gentleman.</p>

<p>“Glad to welcome you,” said the man. “My
name is Nathan Seabury. These are my daughters,
Rose, Nellie and Olivia,” indicating each
one in turn. “We are traveling about on this
houseboat. The girls pretend it is for my health,
but I strongly suspect it is for their own.”</p>

<p>“Now father!” exclaimed Olivia, whom Jerry
decided was the prettiest of the three, “you know
you’re not well, and it’s time for your medicine.”</p>

<p>“Not until morning, young lady!” and Mr.
Seabury winked at the professor.</p>

<p>“Allow me to introduce myself and these
boys,” spoke Mr. Snodgrass, handing out a card,
inscribed with his name and the initials of the
various societies to which he belonged. Then he
gave the names of the boys, and briefly told of
their travels.</p>

<p>“We started from Kissimmee City about two
weeks ago,” explained Mr. Seabury, “and we
have been drifting slowly along ever since, enjoying
life here. Last night the small motor,
which serves to propel our boat at a moderate
speed, broke. We anchored but the rope must
have slipped, for the first thing we knew we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
adrift in the storm. Then we hit this place, and&mdash;well,
here we are.”</p>

<p>“This is an island,” said Jerry. “We camped
here for the night, but the storm woke us up
and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why you are all soaking wet!” interrupted
Nellie. “You will catch cold. Ponto, light the
fire and heat some water. I’ll make some hot
lemonade!”</p>

<p>“Nellie is always afraid some one will catch
cold,” explained her father.</p>

<p>“Don’t go to any trouble on our account,”
said Ned, for which Bob wanted to kick him, as
he was wet and hungry, and it looked as if there
were good things to eat aboard the <i>Wanderer</i>.</p>

<p>The colored man soon had a fire going in the
stove, and the kettle was put on to boil, while
Nellie busied herself in making not only hot lemonade,
but coffee as well, and setting out some
things more substantial, at the sight of which
Bob’s drooping spirits revived.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I can’t offer you some dry garments,”
said Mr. Seabury with a smile, “but the
fact is my boys are all girls. I might help the
professor out&mdash;but the others&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“We have plenty of dry things in our boat,”
said Ned. “I’ll go and get them.”</p>

<p>The plan was voted a good one. Aided by the
searchlight, which was turned to illuminate the
path from the houseboat to where the <i>Dartaway</i>
was moored Ned, borrowing a big raincoat from
Mr. Seabury, went to the craft, and, from the
waterproof lockers took out dry garments for
himself and the others of his party. These he
held under the raincoat and brought aboard the
<i>Wanderer</i>.</p>

<p>The boys and the professor removed their wet
clothes and put on dry ones in one of the spare
rooms of the houseboat, and then sat down to the
meal which Nellie and her sisters, aided by Jeanette,
a colored servant, had prepared.</p>

<p>It was still raining hard, and, as the houseboat
was large, Mr. Seabury’s invitation, that the boys
and the professor stay aboard until morning was
accepted. The <i>Dartaway’s</i> bunks had not been
made up, and to arrange them in the darkness
and rain would have been quite a task. So the
travelers were grateful for the unexpected hospitality
afforded.</p>

<p>It cleared off in the morning, and when the
boys and Mr. Snodgrass arose they looked out on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
a scene of beauty. The island lay in the middle
of a large blue lake that was fringed all around
with big trees, the green foliage of which looked
fresh and clean after the shower.</p>

<p>“It’s your turn to get breakfast, Bob,” observed
Jerry. “Skip ashore and start a fire.”</p>

<p>“I was just going to ask you to do me the
honor to take breakfast with me,” put in Mr. Seabury,
coming on deck. “I’d be very pleased to
have you.”</p>

<p>Ned was going to refuse, as he thought the
addition of four to the eating accommodations
of the <i>Wanderer</i> might prove too great a strain,
but Mr. Seabury anticipated him.</p>

<p>“I am not altogether unselfish in asking you,”
he went on. “I am anxious to have you look at
our engine. Ponto doesn’t seem to be able to
find out what the trouble is, though usually he can
fix it. So if you’ll stay to breakfast and then look
at my motor I’ll be very much obliged.”</p>

<p>“We will!” exclaimed Bob, before any of the
others could answer.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go below and see that the girls have
things in readiness,” said the owner of the houseboat.
“We are living unconventionally here,”
he added. “I find the climate is very good for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
my nerves, which are more at fault than my general
health.”</p>

<p>While breakfast was being prepared the boys
looked over the <i>Wanderer</i>. They found it a
first-class houseboat, with many improvements
and conveniences.</p>

<p>“We’ll give Bob a chance to fix the motor, he
was so anxious to stay,” said Ned to Jerry. “I’d
like to see him sweating over it.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to help,” stipulated Bob.
“You’re just as anxious to stay to breakfast as I
am, only you’re afraid to say so. Come on,
there’s the bell!”</p>

<small>JERRY IS HURT</small></h2>


<p>Breakfast aboard the <i>Wanderer</i> was afterward
voted by the boys as the best meal they had
ever eaten. The three girls who were jolly and
full of fun, made the occasion lively with the
description of their travels, to which the boys
added an account of some of their adventures.</p>

<p>“I wish I was a man!” exclaimed Rose, when
Jerry had told of their trip to the buried city in
Mexico. “That’s what I should like to do.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’ll find some ancient ruins where
you are going,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“We’s going to Lake Okeechobee,” responded
Olivia. “I guess we’ll find nothing but swamps.”</p>

<p>“I believe there is a remnant of several tribes
of Seminole Indians there,” put in Jerry. “Perhaps
you’ll discover a prehistoric city.”</p>

<p>“Oh, are there really Indians?” asked Nellie.
“How perfectly terrible! I’d like to see a little
pappoose, but I’d be afraid of a full blooded
Indian!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>While the young people talked in this strain
Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Seabury were discussing
deeper subjects. Mr. Seabury, it developed, was
quite wealthy, and had helped to found several
scientific schools. He was quite interested in the
professor’s nature studies, and wanted to know all
about the rare butterfly the scientist was seeking.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep a lookout for it,” promised the
owner of the <i>Wanderer</i>. “If I see one I’ll catch
it for you.”</p>

<p>“So will I!” exclaimed Rose, who had listened
to the ending of the conversation. “I’m
fond of animals.”</p>

<p>“The&mdash;er&mdash;butterfly isn’t exactly an animal,”
spoke the professor with a smile. “But I
would be very glad if you could catch one for
me.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll get to Lake Okeechobee
ahead of us,” said Nellie to Jerry. “If you do
we may see you there. It’s rather a large body
of water, according to the map, but I expect you
will navigate most of it.”</p>

<p>“We plan to make a circuit of it,” answered
Ned. “We may find some one we know there.”</p>

<p>“Who?” asked the girl, but before Ned could
state that he referred to Noddy Nixon, Mr. Seabury
called out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now would one of you boys mind looking at
our engine? I’d like to get under way again.”</p>

<p>“There’s your chance, Bob!” whispered Ned,
but Bob did not have to undertake the job, for
Jerry, who had a natural fondness for machinery,
was soon tinkering away at the motor. He found
that the mechanism which controlled the electric
spark was out of order and, though it was no easy
matter to adjust, he soon had the machine working
better than ever.</p>

<p>Mr. Seabury was very grateful, and pressed
the boys and Mr. Snodgrass to spend several days
aboard the <i>Wanderer</i>. The chums were half-minded
to, but the professor was impatient to
begin the hunt for the rare butterfly, the haunts
of which were farther south, so they prepared to
leave their island camp.</p>

<p>The hot sun and wind soon dried out the wetness
of the night before, and when everything had
been packed aboard the <i>Dartaway</i> the boys bade
their host and his pretty daughters good-bye.
Then, voicing the hope that they would meet
again soon, those in the motor boat started down
the lake toward the Kissimmee river, while the
<i>Wanderer</i> followed more slowly.</p>

<p>“They’re a nice lot of girls,” observed Bob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
with a sigh, as a turn of the lake hid the houseboat
from sight. “Very nice girls.”</p>

<p>“Which one?” asked Jerry with a smile.</p>

<p>“All of ’em!”</p>

<p>“A very fine man!” was the professor’s comment
on Mr. Seabury. “He has traveled much
and has seen many strange insects. A very
learned man.”</p>

<p>They were now in a fine region, a country
higher than the usual low level of Florida, and
noted for the variety of its crops. They passed
through several large cattle ranges and again
through long stretches of dense forests. Now
and then they would come to a little colony where
fruit growers had settled. At noon they went
ashore near a little village and had dinner.</p>

<p>“Boys!” exclaimed the professor, as they prepared
to resume their journey, “I’ve had good
news!”</p>

<p>“Did some one tell you where to find that butterfly?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“No, but a man in the village said there was a
curious mound about ten miles below here, a
mound erected by a prehistoric race, I believe. I
must investigate it. Who knows but I shall find
some valuable relics?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“You mean a heap of dirt such as the Ohio
mound builders put up?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“The same, my boy, only I think this one will
be richer in historical treasures. The man said it
was seldom visited by any one in this region. He
was guiding a hunting party one day and discovered
it. Come, we must hurry off. I want to
see it before dark.”</p>

<p>Once more the <i>Dartaway</i> was sent ahead. The
river wound in and out in the dense forest, now
broadening and again narrowing. Sometimes it
was quite shallow and then would come a deep
place, in which several varieties of fish could be
observed in the clear depths. Bob wanted to
catch some for supper, but the professor was anxious
to keep on, so no stop was made.</p>

<p>“I think that’s the place!” Mr. Snodgrass exclaimed
after several hours. “The man said
when I saw three big palmetto trees on a little
point of land to go ashore and then walk due
west. There are the three trees,” and he pointed
to them.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t look like a very inviting region,” remarked
Jerry as he sent the boat over toward
the little point. “But I suppose that makes it all
the better for the mound. Well, professor, we’ll
go ashore and see what we can find.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Mooring the boat to the bank, the boys leaped
out, the professor pausing to take several specimen
boxes and his butterfly net.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll take my gun,” announced Bob,
turning back. “I might get a shot at something.”</p>

<p>He took his weapon, a combination rifle and
shot gun, while the others went on ahead of him.</p>

<p>“Looks as though there was a path here,” said
Jerry, pointing to a sort of trail through the
woods.</p>

<p>“So it does,” admitted Mr. Snodgrass. “Well,
so much the better for us.”</p>

<p>“Unless it has been made by a band of Indians
or some ugly negroes,” said Jerry in a low tone.
“I’ve read there are some black men who live in
the swamps about here, and that they are worse
than Indians.”</p>

<p>“Better call to Bob to come up front with his
gun,” spoke Ned.</p>

<p>“No, it might alarm the professor,” replied
Jerry. “But keep your eyes open.”</p>

<p>They followed the path, which wound in and
out among the trees. Suddenly the professor,
who had made his way to the fore, uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry, looking to
see that Bob, with his gun, was close by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“The mound!” cried the scientist, pointing to
a large hill to be seen through the masses of moss
hanging from the trees.</p>

<p>“It’s a mound, sure enough,” admitted Jerry.
“Let’s see what it’s like.”</p>

<p>As they approached they saw that it was undoubtedly
the work of human hands. It was
shaped like a pyramid, and on either side stretched
level land, covered with a dense growth of forest
or underbrush.</p>

<p>“There are steps leading to the top!” cried
Bob, who had gone around to the far side of the
artificial hill. The others joined him and saw
him ascending a rude flight of stairs made of
stones set into the side of the mound.</p>

<p>“Better go slow,” advised Jerry. “No telling
what’s up there.”</p>

<p>“Let me look for relics!” exclaimed the professor,
and he hurried past Bob. “I’m sure there
must be lots of them in this place.”</p>

<p>Bob stood aside while Jerry, who, as usual, assumed
the leadership when there was a hint of
danger, took the rifle. Then he started to follow
the professor.</p>

<p>Jerry had not taken half a dozen steps when he
trod on a loose stone. He nearly fell backward
but recovered himself by an effort. In doing so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
however, he leaned too far to one side. The next
instant he had fallen and slid to the bottom of the
mound.</p>

<p>The hammer of the gun came in contact with a
stone or stick, and the weapon was discharged with
a loud report. Fortunately the muzzle was
pointed upward, and the bullet endangered no one.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” cried Ned and Bob, hurrying
to Jerry’s aid.</p>

<p>They noticed that his face was white and drawn.</p>

<p>“I’m&mdash;afraid so,” he murmured, clenching
his teeth to keep back a murmur of pain.</p>

<p>“Where is it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“My leg!”</p>

<p>They noticed that his left leg was doubled under
him. As tenderly as they could they lifted him
up. As they did so Bob saw a stream of blood
trickling from Jerry’s foot.</p>

<p>“You’re shot!” he cried. “Oh Jerry!”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t the bullet,” said Jerry. “I think
I ran a sharp stone through my shoe as I fell.”</p>

<p>The two chums bent closer to look.</p>

<p>“It’s an Indian arrow head!” exclaimed Ned
as he saw the long sharp piece of flint piercing the
side of Jerry’s shoe. “I’ll pull it out.”</p>

<p>He tried, but it was imbedded in the flesh more
firmly than he had thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Jerry, and then the terrible
pain, as Ned tried to withdraw the ancient weapon,
made him faint.</p>

<p>“Professor!” cried Bob. “Jerry’s hurt!”</p>

<p>The scientist had disappeared on the top of the
mound. Hardly had the echoes of Bob’s voice
died away than from the forest surrounding the
mound there emerged a band of ugly-looking negroes.
They started to run toward the boys just
as Mr. Snodgrass, hearing the call of distress,
began to descend the stone steps.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>THE SEMINOLE CHIEF</small></h2>


<p>Jerry’s faintness however, was of short duration.
When Ned ceased trying to extract the stone
the terrible pain subsided, for the time being, and
Jerry opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“Let the professor take it out,” he murmured.
“He can do it.” Then he caught sight of the advancing
negroes. “Where’s the gun?” he asked.</p>

<p>Bob had secured it after Jerry’s fall, and at this,
he raised it in readiness, though he did not point it
at the black men. At the sight of it, however,
they stopped. One of them, who seemed to be a
leader, raised his hand and called out:</p>

<p>“What yo’ uns want heah?”</p>

<p>“We came to look at this curious mound,” replied
the professor, speaking in conciliatory tones.
“We were looking for relics. Why? What
has happened?” he exclaimed as he saw the blood
on Jerry’s foot. Evidently he had not heard
Bob’s cry.</p>

<p>“I ran an Indian arrow head into my foot,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
answered Jerry. “I guess you’ll have to get it
out, Professor.”</p>

<p>“Looks as though we were going to have trouble
with these negroes,” put in Ned. “We must
look out.”</p>

<p>“Yo’ uns had better make tracks away from
heah!” went on the leader of the black men.
“We don’t like strangers heah!”</p>

<p>“We can’t go until I attend to this lad’s injury,”
spoke Mr. Snodgrass firmly. “Lie down Jerry,
and I’ll get the arrow out. This confirms my suspicions
that the mound was built by Indians.”</p>

<p>“I’m pretty sure of it, judging from the way
my foot feels,” said the injured lad.</p>

<p>He was sitting on one of the lower stone steps,
and Ned was taking off his shoe and stocking.
He had to cut the leather and cloth in order to remove
them from around the arrow head which was
still sticking firmly into the fleshy part of Jerry’s
foot. The latter bore the pain bravely, though
he had to grit his teeth to keep from yelling as
Ned’s hands came in contact with the stone, moving
it in the tender wound.</p>

<p>“Git away from heah!” ordered the negro
leader. “This is our property an’ we don’t want
nobody heah!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll have to wait until I fix up this lad’s
foot,” insisted the professor.</p>

<p>“We uns ain’t goin’ to wait.”</p>

<p>The negroes had gathered around their leader
and seemed as if about to advance on the professor
and the three boys. They were an ugly looking
lot.</p>

<p>“Look out for trouble,” said Ned in a low tone.
“I wish we’d brought our guns. Bob, can you
shoot straight?”</p>

<p>“Don’t do any shooting,” advised the scientist.
“They are too many for us and it would only make
them more savage to fire on them. I must try
other measures.”</p>

<p>The professor endeavored to argue with the colored
men, but they insisted that the travelers must
leave the place at once. There were greedy eyes
taking in every detail of the dress of the party and
the sight of the boys’ watch chains excited a cupidity
that boded no good. The professor saw
that their position was a dangerous one.</p>

<p>“I think we had better get out of here,” he said.
“Can you walk, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not.”</p>

<p>One look at his foot showed that it would be
out of the question. Even with the arrow head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
removed it would be a task, and the professor
dared not extract the weapon, as, while he was
doing so the negroes might rush on them. Probably
the worst that would happen would be robbery,
but the travelers were in no humor to be despoiled
of their possessions.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to carry him,” said Ned. “You
and I can manage it, Mr. Snodgrass. Bob can
act as an escort with the gun, and when we are in
the boat you can attend to Jerry.”</p>

<p>This was voted the only feasible plan. Jerry’s
foot was not bleeding much, as the arrow in the
wound prevented a heavy hemorrhage. Still the
lad was weak from the pain.</p>

<p>“Are yo’ uns goin’ to git out of heah?” demanded
the leading negro again, and he advanced
menacingly.</p>

<p>“We’re glad to get out of the neighborhood
where such inhospitable people live,” remarked
Mr. Snodgrass, as he slung his collecting box over
his shoulder by a strap, and prepared to help carry
Jerry.</p>

<p>Bob brought up in the rear with the gun, after
Ned had gone to the aid of the scientist, and perhaps
the sight of the weapon prevented a hostile
demonstration on the part of the black men.
They followed the travelers for a short distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
as they went on with the wounded lad along the
path that led to where they had left the <i>Dartaway</i>.</p>

<p>“I hope they don’t give us any more trouble,”
remarked Bob, as they neared their craft. “If
they have boats they may come after us.”</p>

<p>“They’d have to have pretty good boats to get
ahead of ours,” observed Ned.</p>

<p>It was no easy task to transport Jerry along the
narrow path, and, several times, the professor and
Ned had to rest. But they finally made a turn in
the trail that put them on the straight stretch
which led directly to the boat.</p>

<p>“There she is!” cried Ned. “Now we’re all
right!”</p>

<p>As he spoke there was a rustling in the grass
along the path. Bob, with ready gun, turned
quickly. The boys had a glimpse of several dusky
faces peering at them.</p>

<p>“The negroes!” exclaimed Ned. “They’re
following us!”</p>

<p>“Hurry on!” spoke Bob. “Get into the boat
and start up. They’ll not come very near as long
as we have a gun!”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke the black men seemed to melt
away like shadows and the rustling was heard no
longer. On they hurried to the <i>Dartaway</i>. Jerry
was placed on a pile of cushions, and Ned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
started the motor. As the boat swung out toward
the middle of the river they saw, emerging from
the bushes and standing on the shore, half a score
of negroes, who shook their fists at the travelers.</p>

<p>“We’re well rid of them,” murmured the professor,
as he prepared to extract the arrow head
from Jerry’s foot. “But I wish I could have
stayed at that mound. It was filled with historical
relics and treasures, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>With Ned steering the boat, which, after it had
gotten well away from the hostile negroes was sent
along at slow speed, the professor called to Bob to
assist him in affording relief to Jerry. The scientist
saw that he would have to cut the weapon from
the lad’s flesh, as the barbs held it too firmly to allow
it being removed in any other way.</p>

<p>“Can you stand some pain?” asked Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” replied Jerry grimly.</p>

<p>“If I only had some chloroform,” went on the
scientist, “I could give you a whiff of it, and it
would numb your senses a little. But I haven’t
any. I guess you’ll have to stand it, my boy. I’ll
be as gentle as I can.”</p>

<p>The professor carried a small set of surgical
instruments with him, for use in dissecting the animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and insects he collected. He now produced
several shining knives, at the sight of which Jerry
did not have the most cheerful feelings in the
world. But he knew the arrow head must be removed.</p>

<p>Mr. Snodgrass cleansed the knives in some antiseptic
liquid he had among his possessions, and
then made ready to cut the weapon out.</p>

<p>“Keep the boat as steady as possible,” he called
to Ned. “Bob, you hold Jerry’s foot. It will
soon be out.”</p>

<p>Jerry had a dim remembrance that he had heard
some one say that before. He recalled that it was
a dentist. A faint feeling was overcoming him.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ned uttered a cry, and pointed ahead.
The professor suspended his surgical preparations
and looked up. So did Bob and Jerry. The latter
was on the point of fainting.</p>

<p>What they saw was a canoe, containing a solitary
figure, crossing the river. As they watched
they saw the frail craft upset, and, a moment later
the man who was in it was struggling in the water.</p>

<p>“Go to his rescue! Never mind me!” cried
Jerry. “I can wait. Save the man!”</p>

<p>At a nod from the professor Ned speeded up
the engine and steered the boat toward where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
man had disappeared beneath the surface of the
river. In a few seconds the <i>Dartaway</i> was at the
place.</p>

<p>“Can you see him?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s right here!” exclaimed Ned, reversing
the screw and bringing the motor craft to
a stop. “Pass me the boat hook, Bob. He
seems to be held down by a tangle of grass or
weeds!”</p>

<p>Bob passed the hook forward. Ned lowered it
into the water and caught the blunt point in the
clothing of the submerged man. With Bob’s aid
he drew him to the surface.</p>

<p>As the man’s head came out of the water he
shook it to relieve himself of the water. Then,
taking a long breath, which showed that he had
held it while deprived of air, he uttered a grunt
and proceeded to climb into the <i>Dartaway</i>.</p>

<p>“He’s a negro!” exclaimed Bob in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Me no black man!” exclaimed the rescued
one, shaking himself like a dog and thereby splashing
water over all in the boat. “Me Indian.
My name Ottiby. Me chief! Ugh!”</p>

<p>“An Indian,” murmured Ned.</p>

<p>“He is one of the Seminole tribe,” put in the
professor. “I recognize the characteristics.”</p>

<p>“Paddle catch in long grass,” went on Ottiby,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
as if in excuse for such a child of nature as an Indian
letting water get the best of him. “Me go
overboard. Get caught in weeds. No can git
loose. Steamboat come along. Boy pull Ottiby
out. Good boy. Ottiby no forget. Can get
canoe?”</p>

<p>This last seemed to be a question which Ned interpreted
as a desire on Ottiby’s part to have his
boat back again. Accordingly the <i>Dartaway</i> was
sent ahead again, and the frail craft, which was
hollowed from a log, was secured, together with
the paddle which had come to the surface.</p>

<p>“Good!” spoke Ottiby with a grunt, when he
saw his property secure. “Me no forget white
man and boys,” and he looked at the travelers.</p>

<p>As he caught sight of the knife in the professor’s
hand, and saw Jerry’s bared foot, with the
bloody arrow head sticking in it, the Indian gave
a start of surprise.</p>

<p>“Boy hurt?” he asked. Then, without waiting
for an answer. “Cut out arrow. Me know.
Go ashore. Me get somet’ing stop pain. Ottiby
know. Put ashore!”</p>

<p>“Steer the boat to land, Ned,” said the professor.
“I believe we saved this Indian in the nick
of time. He probably knows of some plant that
I can use to make it less painful for Jerry while I
cut the arrow out.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>CAUGHT IN SAW GRASS</small></h2>


<p>Ottiby made his way to the stern where he held
the rope fastened to his canoe, by which it was being
towed. Though he had been near to death he
seemed perfectly at his ease now, with no regard
of what might have happened if the travelers in
the speedy <i>Dartaway</i> had not come along. But
that he was not ungrateful was shown by his quick
thought in the matter of Jerry.</p>

<p>The motor boat was moored in a little cove but,
even before it was made fast Ottiby had leaped
ashore and disappeared in the woods.</p>

<p>“Looks as if he was running away,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“No danger,” replied the professor. “He’s
going for the plant, I believe.”</p>

<p>The professor was correct. In about ten minutes
Ottiby returned. In his hand he held several
long roots. Mr. Snodgrass tried to discover what
they were, but the chief knew only the Indian name
for them, and they were a species of plant with
which the scientist was not familiar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Me make foot feel no pain,” said Ottiby as he
took the roots and rolled them into a compact
mass. This he wet in the river and then he
pounded the fibers with a wooden club he had
picked up in the woods. When he had the roots
into a sort of rude plaster he laid it on Jerry’s foot,
over the wound.</p>

<p>“So like Indians do,” Ottiby said. “Wait
while then can cut and no feel.”</p>

<p>In about five minutes Jerry exclaimed.</p>

<p>“It feels as if my foot was going to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Then the stuff is working,” remarked Mr.
Snodgrass. “We’ll wait a while longer and then
I’ll take the arrow head out. I’m glad we rescued
Ottiby.”</p>

<p>As a test of the power of the Indian’s medicine
the professor, after waiting a while longer, stuck
a pin in Jerry’s foot near the wound.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel it a bit,” the lad said.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll operate,” announced Mr. Snodgrass.
Jerry closed his eyes as he did not like to see
the action of the knife. In a few minutes the scientist
announced that it was all over and that the
arrow head was out. He showed it to Jerry, and
an ugly enough weapon it was.</p>

<p>“I hope it isn’t poisonous,” remarked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Not much danger of that, I think,” said Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Snodgrass. “If there was ever poison on it the
stuff has lost its power, for the head must have
lain on the ground for a hundred years or more.
Now I’d like to have some healing medium with
which to bind up the wound. I wonder if Ottiby
knows of some herbs I might use.”</p>

<p>He inquired of the Indian, explaining as well as
he could what was wanted. The chief nodded his
head, and once more disappeared in the woods.
He was not gone so long this time, and, when he
returned he had a bunch of leaves. These he
bruised up and bound on Jerry’s foot.</p>

<p>“How do you feel?” asked the professor when
the rude dressing had been applied.</p>

<p>“It’s beginning to pain some, but I can stand
it.”</p>

<p>“The numbing effect of the roots is wearing
off,” said the scientist. “It will hurt for a while,
I expect, and then perhaps the leaves will make it
better.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve had a rather strenuous afternoon,”
remarked Bob, when Jerry had been comfortably
propped up with cushions. “Now
what’s next on the program? Supper I believe.”</p>

<p>“You’re not going to give anyone else a chance
to vote, are you, Chunky?” cried Ned. “Never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
mind, I believe you’re right. Come on, and we’ll
get a meal ready.”</p>

<p>The old Indian, who had not taken the trouble
to remove his wet clothes sat on the stern of the
<i>Dartaway</i> watching with curious eyes the preparations
for the meal.</p>

<p>“Shall we ask him to stay?” inquired Bob of
the professor. “He looks hungry.”</p>

<p>“Stay? Eat?” inquired the scientist of the
Indian, making motions toward the victuals which
the boys were laying out.</p>

<p>“Me stay,” was the laconic answer.</p>

<p>After the early supper it was decided they
should camp where they were for the night, until
they saw how Jerry’s sore foot was. The bunks
were made up and the mosquito canopy spread, as,
with the approach of darkness, myriads of these
and other insects made life miserable.</p>

<p>Ottiby watched these preparations with wonder
in his eyes, but said nothing. It was dusk when
he got into his canoe and began to paddle off.</p>

<p>“Me see yo’ some more,” he promised as he
disappeared amid the darkening shadows. “Ottiby
no forget.”</p>

<p>“He’s a queer customer,” remarked Bob, as the
Indian’s boat passed around a bend in the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s a mighty good one,” put in Jerry. “My
foot feels fine.”</p>

<p>Next morning an examination of the wound
showed, to the experienced eyes of the professor,
that it was doing well, though it would take a week
to heal. They decided to find a comfortable place
to camp and go ashore, as there would be more
room to move about.</p>

<p>Jerry wanted his companions to continue the
voyage but the scientist decided they might get to
some place unfavorable to the lad’s speedy recovery,
and he overruled the proposition.</p>

<p>They went down the river a few miles the next
day and found a sort of clearing, near a little cove,
which made an ideal place to stop. There they
remained about ten days. During that time the
professor hunted bugs and butterflies to his heart’s
content. He was constantly on the lookout for
the prize specimen with the blue and gold wings,
but saw no trace of it. However, he was not discouraged,
as he had not counted on coming across
it until he got to Lake Okeechobee.</p>

<p>The leaves which the Indian bound on Jerry’s
foot proved a wonderful medicine. At the end of
ten days the wound was healed, and Jerry could,
by using care, walk on his injured foot.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s about time to resume our trip,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
remarked one morning, when he found he could
get along fairly well. “I’m anxious to get out on
the big lake in our boat.”</p>

<p>Accordingly camp was struck, and once more the
travelers were dropping down the Kissimmee river.
They traveled slowly, and about three days later
they found themselves on a broad lagoon, which,
by the map, they knew opened into Lake Okeechobee.</p>

<p>“Speed her up! We want to reach the lake
before night!” exclaimed Jerry to Bob, who was
at the wheel. Jerry was still acting the part of an
invalid passenger.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better keep near shore,” remarked
the professor. “It looks as if a bad
storm was brewing.”</p>

<p>During the last hour the sky had become overcast
with masses of dull, leaden clouds. The wind
too was increasing in power and the waters of the
lagoon began to break into waves in the midst of
which the <i>Dartaway</i> pitched and tossed.</p>

<p>“I think it would be wise to go ashore,” said
Jerry. “We’d better camp there for the night.
We can go out on the lake in the morning.”</p>

<p>Bob put the wheel over and they landed at a
place where tall green grass came down almost to
the water’s edge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll have to hustle to get the tent up if we’re
going to sleep here to-night,” said Ned. “That
long grass looks as if there might be snakes in it.”</p>

<p>“If there are perhaps I can get a few specimens,”
spoke Mr. Snodgrass. “But come on,
boys. The storm will soon be upon us.”</p>

<p>Bob and Ned, aided by the scientist, and by
Jerry, who could perform light tasks, soon had the
tent up. They securely moored the <i>Dartaway</i>,
and then set about making things comfortable for
the night. The wind was increasing in force, and
a few drops of rain fell, but the boys knew their
tent was a strong and dry one, and securely put
up.</p>

<p>They went to bed early, as it had been a tiresome
day. Shortly before midnight they were all
awakened by a crash. Then it seemed as if a
giant hand had lifted their tent from the ground.
An instant later they felt a deluge of rain.</p>

<p>“Secure the tent! Hold it down! Grab the
ropes!” yelled Ned.</p>

<p>Bob and the professor sprang to aid him, but
they were too late. The tent was blown down.</p>

<p>Out from under the clinging canvas they struggled
into the darkness of the storm, for the wind
had extinguished their lanterns. They could not
see which way to go to get to their boat, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
they knew they would be sheltered, for they had
put up the awning before camping out.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bob uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“Something has cut me!”</p>

<p>“Me too!” cried Jerry. “It feels as if a lot
of knives were sawing my hands and face.”</p>

<p>“It’s the giant saw-grass!” called the professor.
“It grows in this region. The wind is whipping
the long blades into our faces. Stoop down, boys,
or you’ll be badly cut!”</p>

<p>They tried to do this, but it seemed as if the saw-grass
was all over. In the darkness they had
plunged into a patch of the dreaded stuff. The
serrated edges of the rush-like growth scarified
their skin like knives, and the boys and the professor
were soon bleeding from several places.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>THE BIG SNAKE</small></h2>


<p>Dangerous indeed was the plight of the travelers.
In the darkness, and with the storm at its
height, they were entangled in the patch of saw-grass,
and could not discover which way to escape
from it. The wind lashed the keen edges across
their hands and faces again and again.</p>

<p>“Stand still!” cried the professor. “The
more we move the worse it is! Has any one any
matches?”</p>

<p>“I have!” cried Bob, “but I don’t believe I
can light ’em in this downpour.”</p>

<p>“Try,” suggested Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>Bob tried, but with no success. Then Ned uttered
a cry.</p>

<p>“This way!” he called as a flash of lightning
illuminated the scene for a brief instant. “I can
see the water!”</p>

<p>The others made their way toward the sound of
his voice. Bewildered, however, as they were by
the storm and dense blackness which followed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
lightning flash, they rushed but the deeper into the
terrible grass.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Ned, who, by good fortune
had succeeded in reaching an open place near the
water, where there was none of the sharp grass.
“Move when you see the flashes!”</p>

<p>“Hurry to the boat!” called Mr. Snodgrass.
“I hope it hasn’t slipped its moorings in the
storm.”</p>

<p>That was a trick which the tempest had not
played on the travelers. They found their craft
safe, and were soon aboard and under the stout
awning which kept off the fury of the wind and
rain. In a moment Ned had found the switch
that controlled the small electric lights on the boat,
which were worked by a storage battery. Then
in the security of the little cabin the four looked
at one another.</p>

<p>“This is about the worst yet!” exclaimed Jerry,
as he limped over to a stool and sat down.
The storm made his wounded foot, which was not
quite healed, hurt more than usual. “Your face
is a sight, Bob. Looks as if a cat had been at
you.”</p>

<p>“The same to you and more of it,” responded
Ned. “I guess we all bear the marks of the saw-grass.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>This was so, for the fine keen edges of nature’s
peculiar weapons had left their record on the hands
and faces of all the travelers.</p>

<p>“I think this is where some of the leaves the Indian
chief used on Jerry’s foot would come in
handy,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“If we only had some,” retorted Bob with a
groan. “Even some witch hazel wouldn’t be so
bad, though it smarts at first.”</p>

<p>“I have some of the leaves,” the professor said.
“I observed what kind of a plant they were from
and gathered a supply the other day. I will get
them.”</p>

<p>Removing most of their soaked garments, and
wringing out the water, the boys and the scientist
were soon busy pounding up the leaves to make a
sort of ointment for their scratches. The foliage
gave out a sticky salve which, when applied to the
cuts made by the grass, soothed them.</p>

<p>“We look like a lot of Seminole Indians with
our war paint on,” remarked Ned, and indeed the
four did present a curious sight, for they were
daubed with green stuff in streaks and patches.</p>

<p>“Now for some hot coffee,” announced Bob, as
he set the gasoline stove going. “That will make
us feel as well inside as the leaves do outside.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“Trust Chunky for knowing what’s good for
the inside,” retorted Ned. “However go ahead,
Bob. We’re all with you.”</p>

<p>Warmed and exhilarated by the hot drink the
travelers listened with better spirits to the patter of
the rain on the awning. They got out some dry
garments from the lockers and then, making up
the folding bunks with which the <i>Dartaway</i> was
provided, they spent the rest of the night in comparative
comfort.</p>

<p>The storm was over at sunrise, and as the boys
peered from the curtained cabin they gazed out on
scene of beauty. They were on the shore of a
broad lagoon which gave entrance into Lake Okeechobee.
Behind them, some distance back, was a
dense forest, and, nearer to them was the dreadful
saw-grass. Over the stretch of water myriads of
birds were flying, while, every now and then, a
splash and a shower of glistening drops told that
a hungry fish was trying to get an early breakfast.</p>

<p>“How do you boys feel?” asked Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“Much better,” announced Jerry, and the others
said the same. The pain from their cuts and
scratches was all gone, so quick-acting was the Indian’s
remedy. After breakfast they went ashore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and got the tent and camp stuff which, though
much scattered, had not suffered any material
damage.</p>

<p>“No more camping on this shore!” exclaimed
Ned as he looked at the waving saw-grass.</p>

<p>“I must get some specimens,” the scientist said.
“I have read about the peculiar properties of this
plant but I never came across it before.”</p>

<p>“You want to put gloves on if you try to go in
there,” cautioned Jerry, and this the professor did.
In that way he was able to secure some of the grass
for his cabinet of curiosities, which was already
assuming large proportions.</p>

<p>“Now for Lake Okeechobee proper!” cried
Bob as the boat was once more started off. They
were soon out of the lagoon and in due time
emerged around a point of land and beheld,
stretched out before them the largest lake of Florida,
a beautiful sight under the gleaming southern
sun.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for the everglades!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“And Noddy Nixon’s cocoanut grove,” added
Jerry. “I wonder if we’ll see him?” He also
thought of the deed to the land his mother had
bought, and vaguely dwelt on the possibility of locating
it.</p>

<p>“Now I must get seriously to work and look for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
my rare butterfly,” remarked the professor, as he
began to rummage among his nets and other insect-catching
accessories. “I hope you boys will be on
the watch for it, as it means a great deal to me.”</p>

<p>They assured him that they would, and then
Ned, who was steering, increased the speed of the
motor until the boat shot along at a fast rate
through the blue waters of the lake.</p>

<p>“Look there!” cried Bob suddenly, pointing
just ahead.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“A big fish leaped half way out of the water.
There must be fine sport here. I’m going to try
to catch some for dinner, as it’s almost noon.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” remarked Ned. “I’ll slow down
for you.”</p>

<p>Bob baited his hook and, in a short time had
caught a fine fish. Then Jerry joined him in the
sport, and in half an hour they had enough for a
meal. They went ashore, and Jerry, who volunteered
to act as cook, quickly had the finny specimens
frying in bacon fat which browned to a
golden hue the corn meal into which the fish were
dipped.</p>

<p>There wasn’t much left when they cleared away
the wooden dishes that they used, and then, after
a consultation, it was decided to camp for a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
days at the spot where they had landed. This
would give their cuts a chance to heal and by making
short excursions here and there they could get
acquainted with the character of the lake.</p>

<p>It was on the third day of their camping out on
the shore of Lake Okeechobee that, as they were
returning in the motor boat one afternoon Jerry,
who had taken the wheel, suddenly called out:</p>

<p>“Doesn’t that sound like some one in our
camp?”</p>

<p>They were close to where they usually moored
the boat, about fifty feet from where the tent was
set up.</p>

<p>“Some one is rattling away among the pots and
pans,” remarked Ned. “Maybe it’s some of
those negroes who have followed us.”</p>

<p>“Or Seminole Indians,” added Bob.</p>

<p>“More likely some animal,” observed the professor.</p>

<p>“Then it had better leave before I take a shot
at it,” exclaimed Bob, getting his gun in readiness.</p>

<p>The boat was approaching closer, and the noise
amid the camp stuff could be plainly heard. It
sounded as though some animal like a cow was
nosing among a lot of tin pails after something to
eat. Jerry shut off the power and the boat slowly
drifted to the shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let me get at him!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Look out! It may be a manatee!” cautioned
Ned with a laugh.</p>

<p>But his laugh was stopped short for, an instant
later they all beheld something that almost made
their hearts stop beating.</p>

<p>They could look into the midst of the camp, and
there, in front of the tent, writhing about in a confusion
of dishes and food, was an immense snake!</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>AN UNEXPECTED ENCOUNTER</small></h2>


<p>“Quick with that gun, Bob!” cried Jerry.
“Now’s your chance for a shot!”</p>

<p>Bob raised his weapon and fired, but his nervousness,
and the sudden terror into which the sight of
the reptile threw him, made his aim unsteady.
The bullet cut the branches of a tree four feet
above the serpent.</p>

<p>“Let me try!” exclaimed the professor. “I
think I can get him.”</p>

<p>Bob handed over the gun.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t mean with that,” and the scientist
began making a slip noose with a rope.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’m going to try to capture that snake alive,”
answered Mr. Snodgrass. “I recognize it as a
valuable specimen of a water reptile, something
like the giant boas of the tropics. If I can capture
it and ship it up north I will get a good sum
from the museum. Steady with the boat and let
me get ashore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“The snake will kill you!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“No, they are comparatively harmless,” remarked
the scientist. “The only danger is in being
caught in their powerful coils. They are not
poisonous.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me from that sort of a job,” murmured
Ned.</p>

<p>By this time the boat had run ashore, the keel
grating on the gravel at the edge of the lake.
The professor had made a running noose and held
it extended in front of him by means of the boat
hook.</p>

<p>“I’ll try and get close enough to the reptile to
slip the noose over his head,” he remarked to Jerry.
“When I do, send the boat back into the lake
and I think we’ll have him just where we want
him.”</p>

<p>“Suppose he tackles you?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid. I’ve handled snakes before,”
announced Uriah Snodgrass confidently.</p>

<p>He cautiously approached the reptile. The big
serpent seemed to be searching in the camp for
something to eat. It crawled here and there, poking
its ugly head into all the openings visible and
overturning several boxes.</p>

<p>“It’s a whopper!” cried Ned as a nearer view
showed the real size of the reptile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the professor was approaching
closer and closer, holding the dangling noose ready
to slip over the serpent’s head. Suddenly the creature
raised itself so that the scientist thought he
had a chance. He rushed forward with a cry to
the boys to be in readiness. Ned shoved the boat
off shore and Jerry stood ready to start the motor,
while Bob had secured the end of the rope about
a cleat.</p>

<p>All at once the snake caught sight of the man
advancing with the rope. It must have been
aware of the hostile intentions of the professor
for it instantly gave vent to a loud hiss and coiled
up ready for action.</p>

<p>“Look out, Mr. Snodgrass!” called Jerry.
“He’s got an ugly look!”</p>

<p>The professor did not reply. Stepping cautiously
he kept on advancing, holding his noose in
readiness. It was a brave act but probably only a
person who would dare much in the interests of science
would have undertaken it.</p>

<p>Suddenly the professor cast his noose. Now
either he was not an expert in the use of the lasso,
or the snake instinctively knew how to avoid such
dangers. At any rate the reptile swayed its head
to one side and the rope fell harmlessly to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
ground. The next instant the snake had uncoiled
and was wiggling straight for the professor.</p>

<p>“Run!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Jump!” advised Jerry.</p>

<p>“Hit him with a club!” was Ned’s caution.</p>

<p>The professor did not heed the advice. With
a bravery, worthy perhaps of a better cause, he
made a spring not away from but right at the
snake. He explained afterward that he hoped to
grab it around the neck and choke it.</p>

<p>But he missed his aim, and the next moment
<a href="#image03">there was a confused tangle of man and snake on
the ground</a>. All the boys could see was a striped
tail threshing about while, every now and then,
the professor’s legs were visible. He had some
sort of a grip, but it was not the right kind, on the
reptile.</p>

</a><br /><div class="caption"><a href="#Page_137">THERE WAS A CONFUSED TANGLE OF MAN AND SNAKE ON THE GROUND</a></div>
</div>

<p>“We must go ashore and help him! He’ll be
killed!” shouted Ned.</p>

<p>“Give me the gun, Bob!” yelled Jerry. “I’ll
try a shot.”</p>

<p>“Don’t hit the professor,” cautioned Bob.</p>

<p>Ned leaped ashore, followed by his companions
who waded through the intervening shallow water.
They ran toward where the professor was
still struggling with the snake. But, by the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
they arrived the battle was over. Or, rather, it
was a retreat. The snake, probably the worst
scared reptile in Florida at that moment, was headed
for the water, and, as the professor was
stretched out on his back, where a movement of
the strong folds had thrown him the snake glided
into the lake and disappeared amid a series of
ripples.</p>

<p>“There he goes!” cried Bob, while Jerry sent
several bullets from the magazine rifle after it.
But it was too late. The snake got away unharmed.</p>

<p>“Too bad I missed him,” remarked the professor
as he got up and brushed the dirt from his
clothes. “It would have been a valuable specimen.”</p>

<p>“Lucky it didn’t crush you to death,” said Jerry.
“It was a monster.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen larger ones,” observed Mr. Snodgrass.
“I must make a note of this. I will write
a scientific paper about it.”</p>

<p>Fortunately the travelers had returned to camp
before the snake had time to do much damage.
Some fresh fish, which the boys depended on for
their meal, were eaten, and the place was in confusion
from the investigations of the reptile.</p>

<p>“I am glad he didn’t take it into his head to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
come in the night,” remarked Bob. “He’d have
scared us all to death.”</p>

<p>Matters were soon straightened out, the professor
proceeding to note down facts about the reptile
as calmly as though he had not been in danger
of serious injury, if not death, from the encounter.</p>

<p>“If I could only have gotten hold of him
around the neck,” he said, “I’d have him a captive
now.”</p>

<p>“It’s just as well,” remarked Ned. “He
would have been unhandy to cart around, and, if
you got your prize butterfly the snake might have
eaten him up.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted the scientist, finding
some consolation in this thought.</p>

<p>It was on the afternoon of the next day when, as
they were in the boat, making their way along the
eastern shore of the lake, that they approached a
small settlement.</p>

<p>“Here’s civilization,” remarked Jerry as he
saw the cluster of houses. “I didn’t suppose any
one lived here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there are several fruit growers in this
vicinity,” replied the professor, “but after this I
guess we’ll find the lake lonesome enough for we’ll
soon be among the everglades.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>They went ashore as they needed some supplies
and gasoline. While their order was being filled
at the village store the boys strolled out a distance
into the country.</p>

<p>“We’ll be back in a little while, professor,” remarked
Jerry, as the scientist elected to remain in
the store, having caught sight of a curious kind of
black bug on the wall.</p>

<p>The village was so small that the boys had soon
passed its confines. They walked along a little
stream and saw, just ahead of them, two figures.
As they approached nearer they could hear persons
in dispute.</p>

<p>“Seems to me as if I had heard that one voice
somewhere before,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“It does sound familiar,” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>The person with his back to the boys was
saying:</p>

<p>“I tell you this isn’t my land. I know what
I’m talking about. You’re in possession of my cocoanut
grove, and I want it! I didn’t buy this old
swamp!” and the figure turned and pointed to a
morass on the edge of which he was standing.</p>

<p>“You don’t know what you’re talking about!”
exclaimed the other, a man. “I’ve owned this
cocoanut grove for years. You’ve been swindled,
that’s what’s the matter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“I tell you I’m going to have my rights!” retorted
the other. Then he turned and the three
motor boat boys, with one accord exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>INTO A STRANGE LAKE</small></h2>


<p>Whether Noddy or the three chums were the
more surprised it would be hard to say. Though
they had a vague idea they might come across
the Cresville bully in Florida, the motor boys did
not give it serious consideration, hardly believing
Noddy’s story about the cocoanut grove. As for
Noddy he had no intimation that the boys were
coming to Florida and his astonishment, at suddenly
seeing them, was very great. His first remark
was characteristic of him.</p>

<p>“Are you fellows sneaking after me to try and
cheat me out of my grove?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not much!” ejaculated Jerry. “We didn’t
know you were here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you!” retorted Noddy angrily.
“You’re always trying to do me some injury.
Anyhow this man has possession of my
cocoanut grove, that I paid my money for, and
I’m going to have it.”</p>

<p>“How do you know this isn’t your grove?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
asked the man with a smile, indicating the swamp
land.</p>

<p>“Because the magazine advertisement that I
answered said all the groves the company sold
were on high ground. I followed the directions
in reaching this place and this is the only grove on
high ground around here. So it must be mine.”</p>

<p>“That’s your way of looking at it,” replied the
man. “But it doesn’t happen to be the right one.
My name is Carter. If you make some inquiries
in the village you will find that I have owned this
grove for the last twenty years, and that my father
owned it before me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you!” snapped Noddy. “It’s
a plot to cheat me out of my money.”</p>

<p>“Look here!” exclaimed Mr. Carter. “If I
didn’t think you were so young and foolish that
you didn’t know any better I’d make you apologize
for that. As it is I’m not going to take any notice
of you. Are these young friends of yours?
If they are I’d advise them to take you away before
you get into trouble with that temper of
yours, and the unpleasant way you have of using
your tongue.”</p>

<p>“We know him,” Jerry hastened to say, motioning
toward Noddy. “I can’t say we’re
friends of his, nor is he of us. But as we come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
from the same town we’d be glad to do what we
can for him, though he has done us several mean
turns.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any of your help!” exclaimed
Noddy. “You can mind your own business, Jerry
Hopkins, and you too, Bob and Ned. I can get
along without you. I’m going to get possession
of my cocoanut grove and I’ll have this man arrested
for keeping it!”</p>

<p>“You’re talking foolishly,” interposed Mr.
Carter.</p>

<p>“I’ll sue you!” retorted the Cresville bully.
“I tell you I paid a deposit on this grove and I’m
going to have it.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for you, but I think you have been
cheated,” went on Mr. Carter. “I know that
company which pretended to sell you this land.
It is a swindling concern. A number of persons
have been fooled into buying land here and when
they came to take possession of it they found it was
a swamp. But you are the first one who tried to
lay claim to my land,” he added, with a grin.</p>

<p>“You’ll find this no laughing matter!” cried
Noddy, his anger getting the best of him. “I
tell you I’m going to have my rights. I’ll see a
lawyer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you’d better start now,” said Mr. Carter.
“There isn’t any in this village, and the
nearest one is twenty miles away. We don’t have
much use for lawyers down here.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go right away!” cried Noddy. “I’ll
have my rights, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“Maybe your acquaintances will take you to a
lawyer,” went on Mr. Carter, who seemed anxious
to bring Noddy to his senses. “Any one will
tell you that you have been swindled.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go alone and find some one to take up my
case,” exclaimed the Cresville youth. “I don’t
want any help from Jerry Hopkins or any of his
gang, either.”</p>

<p>“We’re not a gang!” objected Bob. “If you
say that again, Noddy Nixon, I’ll&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Go easy,” whispered Jerry to his chum. “Let
him alone.”</p>

<p>“You’ll suffer for this!” ejaculated Noddy,
glowering at Mr. Carter. “I’ll have the law on
you! My father is a rich man and he’ll help me
get my rights. I’ll have you arrested for stealing
my cocoanut grove!”</p>

<p>“There! You’ve said enough!” responded
the man. “I’ll not take any more of your insults!
You’re on my land and I order you off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
What’s more, if you threaten me again I’ll tie you
up and take you before a justice of the peace!
Now move on!”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter looked so angry, and so much in
earnest, that, big bully as he was, Noddy was
frightened. He muttered something below his
breath but he moved off Mr. Carter’s land, and
on to the edge of the swamp which constituted the
“cocoanut grove” of which he had boasted.</p>

<p>“Come on, boys,” said Jerry in a low voice.
“If we stay here we may get involved in some
trouble with Noddy. He doesn’t want our aid,
and I’m glad of it. I’d hate to take him into our
boat. Let’s leave him alone.”</p>

<p>They started away.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix you for following me!” exclaimed
Noddy as he saw the three chums leaving him.
“I’ll get even with you!”</p>

<p>“I hope he comes to his senses soon,” remarked
Mr. Carter, as he walked toward the village
with the three chums. “He is very hot tempered.
He arrived in town a few days ago and
created quite a stir by talking about the big cocoanut
grove he had come to claim. When he found
out that it was only a swamp that the swindlers
had worked off on him he wanted to get my land,
saying a mistake had been made. For several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
days he’s been seeking to lay claim to my grove,
one of the few near here, until I got tired of his
foolishness. Do you know much about him?”</p>

<p>Jerry told Mr. Carter enough of Noddy to
make that gentleman understand what sort of a
youth the Cresville bully was. Mr. Carter said
he was sorry for him, but that he could not afford
to give up his land because Noddy had been
fooled.</p>

<p>Learning that the chums were in no particular
hurry, Mr. Carter invited them up to his house.
He gave them a lunch and brought out some fresh
cocoanuts, in a green state, which is when they are
at their best for eating. He called one of his
negro helpers and told him to open some of the
nuts for the boys.</p>

<p>The negro set up in the ground a stake, sharpened
on the end. Then, holding the nut, encased
in its husky fibrous covering in both hands, he
brought it down on the point of the stick with a
slanting motion. The sharp point cut through
the husk in an instant and the nut was exposed.
Then the end was chopped off with a big knife and
the interior, consisting of “milk” and soft pulp,
was ready to eat.</p>

<p>“I never knew cocoanuts were so good!” exclaimed
Bob, as he tackled his fourth one, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
they did not eat the rind or hard white part.</p>

<p>“No, nor no one else does who gets only the
ripe ones which are shipped north,” explained Mr.
Carter. “We never think of eating anything but
the milk and soft pulp of the partly ripe ones.”</p>

<p>Presently the boys bade their host good-bye and
started for the village store where they had left
the professor catching bugs.</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Jerry, when they were almost
at the place. “We forgot something.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“We didn’t give Noddy the message the man
gave us. We didn’t tell him the government detective
wanted to see him.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go back,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“I believe you’re thinking more of the cocoanuts
than you are of Noddy,” interposed Jerry.
“No, I guess it will keep. Noddy will either go
back home, in which case the detective can see him
himself, or he will stay here and try to get a grove
from some one. If he does the latter we’ll stop
on our way back and give him the message.”</p>

<p>Jerry’s chums thought this the best plan, so they
kept on, dismissing from their minds the thought
of Noddy and his trouble. They found the professor
in his element, catching bug after bug, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the no small amusement of the crowd of natives
that had gathered to watch him.</p>

<p>The supplies were soon put aboard the boat, and
once more the travelers took up their voyage.
For three days they traveled slowly the length of
Lake Okeechobee. At times they kept near shore,
attracted by the beauty of the scenery, for there
were tall palm and palmetto trees, gracefully festooned
with long streamers of Spanish moss.
There was a wealth of tropical vegetation, and
amid the dense forests there flew flocks of birds
of the most brilliant plumage.</p>

<p>Now and then they saw big snakes, and they
passed several alligators without at first knowing
what the saurians were, as they looked so much like
floating logs of wood. When they did discover
that the “logs” were alive the boys tried several
shots at them but without success.</p>

<p>They camped on shore one night but the mosquitoes
and fleas were so bad that thereafter they
stayed on the boat until out of that district. They
caught several fine messes of fish and had a glorious
time. At the close of the fourth day they
approached the end of the lake. By reference to
the map they discovered that they were near to the
land of the everglades, those trackless patches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
dense swamp, lonely and dangerous, inhabited only
by negroes and Indians.</p>

<p>“We ought to see signs of my prize butterfly
soon,” remarked the professor as the boat was
speeding along. “I hope I shall soon capture a
specimen.”</p>

<p>“There’s some kind of a butterfly!” exclaimed
Bob, pointing ahead to where a brilliantly-colored
insect was flying over the water.</p>

<p>“Quick!” cried the professor. “Speed up the
boat, Jerry. It looks like one!”</p>

<p>The craft was put after the butterfly which was
winging its way toward shore. As the <i>Dartaway</i>
advanced the boys noticed that they were entering
a narrow part of the lake. The width of water
quickly decreased until they were in what corresponded
to a river.</p>

<p>“This is queer,” said Jerry. “The map
doesn’t show any place like this.”</p>

<p>“Keep on!” cried the scientist, anxious only
about the butterfly.</p>

<p>The insect led them a long chase. Straight
ahead it flew, and, as the travelers went on they
found themselves between two closely wooded
banks.</p>

<p>“We’ve left Lake Okeechobee behind!” exclaimed
Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken ere the view changed.
They rounded a point of land and came out on a
broad sheet of dark green water.</p>

<p>“It’s another lake!” exclaimed Jerry. “It
must be a strange one, as there is nothing in the
guide book about it, or on the map. Boys, maybe
we’ve discovered a new lake!”</p>

<p>“It’s big enough!” remarked Ned, as he
pointed to the distant shore that marked the
boundary.</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s full of alligators!” cried Bob,
indicating several long black objects floating in the
placid water.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>THE WANDERER AGAIN</small></h2>


<p>“Give me a gun!” cried Ned. “I’m going
to try and hit one in the eye. I’ve read that’s the
place to shoot ’em!”</p>

<p>Jerry steered the boat over to one of the “logs.”
Ned, who had secured his rifle from the locker,
took aim at the nearest creature. He was just
about to pull the trigger, having drawn a bead on
what he supposed was the eye of the saurian, when
the alligator raised its tail and gave the water a
slap that sounded like a clap of thunder. In an
instant all the other alligators disappeared, the one
who had given timely warning diving with its
fellows.</p>

<p>“Just my luck!” cried Ned. “But I’ll get
one yet.”</p>

<p>“There goes my butterfly!” exclaimed the professor,
as he saw the winged creature, he had
been so anxiously watching, take flight over the
woods, where it was soon lost to view. “But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
after all I don’t believe it was the kind I wanted,
though it bore a close resemblance,” with which
reflection the scientist comforted himself. “However,
that shows me we are in the right locality.
I’m glad we discovered this new lake, boys.”</p>

<p>“Let’s name it,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“Call it Alligator Lake,” put in Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, Butterfly Lake would be better,” suggested
Bob, “because the professor hopes to catch
his prize specimen here.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” agreed Jerry. “Butterfly Lake
it is.”</p>

<p>Seeing a little cove about a mile ahead, Jerry
steered the boat in that direction and, as it was
found to be a good stopping place, the craft was
moored near the edge of the water. The boys
and the professor went ashore. They found themselves
in the midst of a patch of everglades, though
close to the lake the land was more firm than anywhere
else.</p>

<p>“I’d hate to be lost in a swamp like that,” remarked
Ned, indicating the vast expanse that lay
about them.</p>

<p>“There are paths through it,” said Mr.
Snodgrass. “But I guess only the negroes and
Indians know them. It would be quite risky for
any one unacquainted with them to venture in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
The swamp would swallow a man as quickly as if
he fell into quicksand.”</p>

<p>“The boat for mine!” exclaimed Bob. “This
is worse than the swamp Noddy got fooled on.”</p>

<p>While supper was being prepared, the professor
got out his nets and cyanide bottle in readiness for
a chase after the prize butterfly.</p>

<p>“I’ll begin the search the first thing in the morning,”
he said, and he was up before daylight, walking
along the shores of the lake looking for the
brilliant creature with a pink body and blue and
gold wings. However, the kind of insect he
wanted seemed to be very scarce, and he came back
empty-handed after the boys had finished their
meal, rather tired but not a bit discouraged. “I’ll
get it yet,” he said. “We’ll cruise along the
shores.”</p>

<p>They found the strange lake was quite a large
body of water. The lower end of it was so filled
with stumps that they did not venture to take the
boat in for fear of striking a snag and stoving a
hole in the bottom. But, though they covered
many miles they did not catch a glimpse of the
rare butterfly.</p>

<p>Bob and Ned tried several shots at alligators,
of which there were many, but, though Bob was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
sure, once, that he hit one, the saurian did not give
any evidence of it, and sank from sight.</p>

<p>If the scientist did not get the butterfly he
wanted, he was successful in capturing a number
of other specimens of insects, which seemed to delight
him almost as much as if he had the pink and
blue beauty.</p>

<p>“Even if I can’t get the five thousand dollars,”
he said, “perhaps I can bring back to the museum
enough valuable specimens so that I will get the
position I want.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll get that butterfly for you,” said
Jerry, who was anxious to help the professor.</p>

<p>“Suppose we go back toward the river that connects
Lake Okeechobee and Butterfly Lake,” suggested
Ned. “That’s where we saw the butterfly
that looked like the one you want.”</p>

<p>“A good idea,” replied Mr. Snodgrass. “I’m
sure it is to be found in this vicinity, as all the
books say it is usually to be seen in company with
the butterfly with plain blue wings, and that is the
one we chased yesterday.”</p>

<p>Accordingly the <i>Dartaway</i> was swung around,
and was soon speeding toward the narrow stretch
of water that connected the two lakes. As they
entered it the boys noticed that there was a current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
flowing from Butterfly Lake into Lake Okeechobee.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t noticed that before,” said Jerry.
“Butterfly Lake must be one of the feeders of the
larger body of water.”</p>

<p>As the <i>Dartaway</i> emerged from the “river”
upon the bosom of Lake Okeechobee once more
Jerry pointed ahead and cried out:</p>

<p>“Look there, boys!”</p>

<p>“It’s another boat!” said Bob.</p>

<p>“A houseboat to judge by the looks of it,” put
in Ned.</p>

<p>“I think it’s our old friend the <i>Wanderer</i>,”
remarked Jerry. “I’ll see if they answer our
signal.”</p>

<p>He gave three toots on the compressed air whistle,
and a moment later they were replied to from
the houseboat, which was about a mile away.
Then something like a white handkerchief was
waved from the deck.</p>

<p>“They see us!” exclaimed Bob. “Those are
the girls.”</p>

<p>“Put over there, Jerry,” said Ned. “I’d like
to see ’em again.”</p>

<p>“Which one?” asked Jerry with a laugh, and
Ned blushed a bit.</p>

<p>Mr. Seabury and his three daughters were glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
to meet the boys once more. The professor and
the youths were invited aboard and, though Mr.
Snodgrass wanted to continue his search for the
butterfly, he was induced to accept the invitation.</p>

<p>“We’ll help you look for that curious insect,”
said Rose Seabury. “We are going to stay on
Lake Okeechobee for some time, and perhaps
we’ll come across it.”</p>

<p>“I hope you do,” remarked the scientist. “I
shall be very much obliged to you if you find a
specimen and I’ll share the reward with you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t mean that!” exclaimed the young
lady. “I’m sure if I could be a little aid to the
advancement of science it would be reward
enough.”</p>

<p>Several pleasant hours were spent aboard the
<i>Wanderer</i> and after dinner, for which Mr. Seabury
insisted that his guests remain, they all sat on
the cool upper deck viewing the beauties of the
lake.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a canoe putting out from shore?”
asked the owner of the houseboat, pointing to a
small object on the water.</p>

<p>“That’s what it is,” answered Nellie, looking
through a pair of marine glasses. “There are
negroes in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, those ugly black men!” exclaimed Olivia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
“I can’t bear them. They are not like the colored
men up north.”</p>

<p>“They seem to be headed this way,” went on
Mr. Seabury, taking the glasses from his daughter.
“I wonder what they want?”</p>

<p>The canoe rapidly approached. In a short
time it was close enough so that, without the aid
of glasses, there could be made out in it three
negroes. They were paddling straight for the
houseboat, to which the <i>Dartaway</i> was made fast.
When the small craft came within hailing distance
one of the negroes called out:</p>

<p>“Is a gen’men dar what’s lookin’ fo’ rare bugs
an’ butterflies?”</p>

<p>“I am,” replied Mr. Snodgrass. “I particularly
want a pink butterfly with blue and gold
wings.”</p>

<p>“We knows whar to find him!” exclaimed the
foremost paddler. “We’ll show yo’ if yo’ uns’ll
come along.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t go with them if I were you,” said
Mr. Seabury in low tones. “They may be very
treacherous.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>A PLOT FOILED</small></h2>


<p>“Wait until I speak to them,” replied Mr.
Snodgrass, preparing to descend to the lower deck.
“I must not lose a chance to get that butterfly.”</p>

<p>He was soon in conversation with the colored
men, who explained they had heard of the scientist’s
object from one of their number who had
come from the village where the travelers had last
stopped, and where the professor had talked of
the butterfly.</p>

<p>“I hope he doesn’t allow himself to be persuaded
to accompany those men,” said Mr. Seabury
to the three boys. “I believe they would
kill him for what valuables he carried, once they
got him off in the swamp.”</p>

<p>“Are they as bad as that?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“They are worse than the Seminole Indians,”
declared Mr. Seabury. “I would sooner trust
one of the latter than a negro of the everglades.”</p>

<p>“I hope the professor doesn’t go,” remarked
Rose. “I like him so much. He’s just like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
very old friend of mine who was a teacher in the
college I attended.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Snodgrass is his own master,” said Mr.
Seabury. “We can only advise him.”</p>

<p>At that moment the scientist came back on the
upper deck.</p>

<p>“I’m on the right track,” he declared, his eyes
shining with excitement. “Those colored men
know just where the butterfly has its haunts. I’m
going with them. It is only a day’s journey.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go along in the motor boat as far as
possible,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, no!” objected Mr. Snodgrass. “We
have to go into the swamp where only a canoe can
be used. Besides, the puffing of the boat’s engine
might frighten the butterfly. I must go alone
with these men. They are honest I’m sure. They
will make a camp for the night and they say they
have food enough for me also.”</p>

<p>“Of course you know your own business,” said
Mr. Seabury, “but I wouldn’t trust them, professor.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sure they will not harm me,” the
scientist replied. “Besides, I have nothing they
could steal. I have promised to pay them well
if they bring me to the place where I can get my
prize butterfly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where is the place?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“It lies to the east of the lake we discovered,”
replied the scientist. “I must start at once.
Those butterflies are scarce and I can’t afford to
take any chances on losing one.”</p>

<p>In spite of the dangers that Mr. Seabury and
his daughters hinted at, and the objections the boys
raised, the professor was determined to accompany
the colored men. Mr. Seabury went below
and took a look at the negroes. He had to admit
that they were good-natured appearing enough,
with broad grins on their shining, black faces and
a manner which seemed to preclude any desire to
do any one an injury.</p>

<p>“Since you have to start from Butterfly Lake
why not go with us as far as there in the motor
boat,” proposed Ned. “The men can follow in
their canoe, or we’ll tow them. Then we can
make a permanent camp, and you’ll know where
to head for when you get ready to come back with
your butterfly.”</p>

<p>This seemed a good idea to the professor and
he agreed to it. The colored men made no objection,
but, on the other hand, seemed to favor the
proposition, which made Mr. Seabury all the more
suspicious.</p>

<p>“I believe those negroes are up to some trick,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
he said to his daughters as their visitors prepared
to leave. “I can’t say what it is, but I’m very
suspicious. I don’t believe those black men know
anything about the butterfly.”</p>

<p>“What can we do, father?” asked Rose.</p>

<p>“Nothing, I’m afraid. Yet I’ll be on the
watch. The <i>Wanderer</i> is not a fast boat, but I
think I’ll keep it near the entrance to Butterfly
Lake for a few days. I may be able to render
some assistance to the professor.”</p>

<p>When good-byes had been said, and assurances
given on the part of Mr. Snodgrass and the boys
that they would see their friends of the houseboat
again, the <i>Dartaway</i>, towing the canoe with the
three negroes, was headed for the stream of water
that connected the two lakes.</p>

<p>A good place for a camp was found near a
small stream that flowed through the everglades,
and up which watercourse the negroes said they
proposed taking the professor in the canoe to
search for the butterfly.</p>

<p>“We’ll be waiting here for you,” remarked
Jerry, as the scientist got his butterfly-catching
accessories together.</p>

<p>“No telling when I’ll be back,” answered Uriah
Snodgrass. “I’m going to get that prize insect,
and it may take longer than these men think.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yo’ll git yo’ butterfly,” said one of the
negroes with a broad grin. “We knows whar
dere’s lots ob ’em.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you better wait until morning?”
suggested Ned. “It’s well along in the afternoon
now, and you can make an early start to-morrow.”</p>

<p>But the professor would hear of no delay. He
had often spent many hours in the open while
searching for curiosities of nature, and a night in
the everglades did not alarm him. The negroes
said they would find some sort of shelter, and,
having packed up some food, the scientist announced
he was ready.</p>

<p>With mingled feelings the boys watched their
friend go off in the canoe with the colored men.
They were disturbed by a vague uneasiness, but
none of them could tell what it was.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Ned, when a turn of the
sluggish swamp stream hid the canoe from sight,
“we’ve no time to lose. We must make camp
before it gets dark.”</p>

<p>Willing hands made light work of setting up
the tent and moving into it blankets and bed clothing
for the night. The <i>Dartaway</i> was moored
in a little cove, and after supper Bob and Ned took
their guns and set out for a shot at some loons,
of which there were many about the lake. Jerry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
carried his rifle, hoping to get a chance at an alligator.</p>

<p>The boys followed the edge of the lake, keeping
watch for anything in the way of game. They
saw several loons, but the queer, big birds were so
far away that a shot was impossible. As Bob
walked along, a little in advance, he came to a
sudden stop behind a clump of bushes.</p>

<p>“Easy!” he exclaimed in a whisper. “I see
one!”</p>

<p>He took careful aim and pulled the trigger.
When the smoke had cleared away the three chums
looked eagerly over the water where, a second before,
a big bird had been seen.</p>

<p>“You’ve blown him to pieces!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Missed him altogether,” said Jerry with a
smile. “Loons, you know, dive at the flash of
the gun, and they’re under water before the shot
gets anywhere near them.”</p>

<p>An instant later the big bird bobbed up from
the water, some distance away from the spot where
Bob had fired at it.</p>

<p>“There he is!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>He took a quick shot, but it seemed to be only
fun for the bird, that instantly dived under the
water again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why don’t you play fair!” exclaimed Bob in
disgust. “I never saw such a bird.”</p>

<p>“That’s the only protection it’s got against
guns,” said Jerry. “You can’t blame it. You’d
do the same. Besides, what good are they after
you shoot ’em? You can’t eat ’em.”</p>

<p>“Sour grapes!” remarked Ned with a laugh.
“But I guess you’re right, Jerry. We can’t hit
’em, at any rate.”</p>

<p>They walked on for some distance farther and
then, as it was getting dusk, returned to camp.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’ll have to have any one sing
me to sleep to-night,” said Bob as he prepared for
bed. “I’m dead tired. How about you, Ned?”</p>

<p>“I guess I can get along without a dose of
soothing syrup.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking we’d better stand watch,” remarked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth I don’t like the idea of
those colored men being in this neighborhood.
Where there are three I think there are sure to be
more. Of course they may be harmless enough,
but I have an idea they are desperate men, and our
camp and boat offers quite a temptation to them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe they’ll bother us,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Bob. “Let’s get what sleep we can. Leave a
lantern where we can light it in a hurry if we hear
any suspicious noises.”</p>

<p>Ned sided with Bob, and Jerry, somewhat
against his will, gave in to them. However, he
determined to stay awake as long as he could.
He also arranged some fishing lines about the
camp so that if any intruders came in they would
trip on them and bring down a collection of pots
and pans which he arranged to fall at the slightest
disturbance.</p>

<p>“That will do for a burglar alarm,” he said.</p>

<p>Jerry’s intention of remaining awake was well
meant, but nature asserted herself and he was soon
slumbering as soundly as his chums.</p>

<p>It was well that Jerry had set his burglar alarm,
or, otherwise the sleep-locked eyes of the boys
never would have detected the stealthy approach of
several dark figures that stole around the camp
about midnight. They were figures that crept
closer and closer with silent footsteps, figures that
whispered now and then among themselves, and,
had any one been listening, they would have easily
recognized the whispers as those of negro voices.</p>

<p>But the fish lines did not sleep. They did their
duty and, when one of the men caught his foot
in a cord, and brought down, with a resounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
clatter and crash, a pile of tins, the three boys
awoke with a start.</p>

<p>“Quick! The guns!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>He struck a match and lighted a lantern which
was ready at hand, no lights having been left burning
because they attracted mosquitoes and other
insects.</p>

<p>Bob and Ned grabbed their rifles. An instant
later the gleam of a lantern shone out, and disclosed
several negroes about the <i>Dartaway</i>. Some
were in the craft and others appeared to be shoving
her off the bank on which her keel rested.</p>

<p>“They’re stealing our boat!” yelled Bob.</p>

<p>An instant later he fired, purposely aiming over
the heads of the intruders. Ned followed his
example. There was a yell of terror from the
black men and, with one accord they seemed to
disappear from sight. Jerry ran out with the
lantern.</p>

<p>“I think we foiled their plot,” he remarked, as
he saw that the boat was still in place, though on
the point of floating away.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>BOB TAKEN ILL</small></h2>


<p>Securing the boat, Jerry took a survey of the
camp. Ned and Bob had lighted other lanterns
and, by their gleams, it could be seen that nothing
had been taken. The improvised burglar alarm
had given timely notice, or the boys might have
mourned the loss of the <i>Dartaway</i>, as well as other
of their possessions.</p>

<p>“They seem to have gotten away,” remarked
Jerry, coming back from where he had made the
motor boat fast. “I wonder how they got
here?”</p>

<p>“In a canoe,” answered Ned, pointing to the
marks of where the keel of one had rested on the
little beach of the lake. “But what was that tremendous
racket?”</p>

<p>“A little invention of mine,” and Jerry explained
it.</p>

<p>“I wonder who they were?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Some of the same negroes with whom the professor
has gone off,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you really think so?”</p>

<p>“I do. I believe it is all a part of a scheme to
rob him and us. Those men wanted to get him
out of the way so they could plunder our camp.
I guess they thought we were boys who had never
been out alone before.”</p>

<p>“They think differently now,” observed Bob.
“I reckon my bullet went uncomfortably close to
some of ’em.”</p>

<p>“We may have scared them off for the time
being,” went on Jerry, “but we’ve got to be on
the watch. Our camp represents a lot of wealth
to those colored men, and they’ll stop at nothing,
short of a gun, to get it. It’ll have to be watch
and watch after this.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” agreed Ned. “We should
have done it at first. But it’s not too late, thanks
to the fish-line burglar alarm.”</p>

<p>The boys arranged to spend the rest of the night
taking turns at standing guard, but their precautions
were needless, for they were not disturbed
again. In the morning they made a more careful
examination and, by the tracks in the mud, came
to the conclusion that at least five men had endeavored
to loot the camp.</p>

<p>“What about the professor?” asked Bob, when
they had discussed the occurrences of the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m worried about him,” admitted Jerry.
“He’s such an innocent and trusting gentleman
that he’d do anything those scoundrels asked him
to. I suppose by this time they have him several
miles away from here.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they’ll harm him?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Maybe not. They’ll certainly rob him, and
they may turn him adrift in the everglades, and
that’s the worst thing they could do. He’ll never
be able to find his way out.”</p>

<p>“Is it as bad as that?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to take too gloomy a view of
it,” went on Jerry, “but you must admit it looks
serious.”</p>

<p>“Still, the professor is a smart man. He’s
used to going in dense woods after insects and
finding his way out,” said Bob. “Look at the
different places he has been with us&mdash;even in the
buried city in Mexico&mdash;and he got out all right.”</p>

<p>“This is different,” Jerry stated. “The everglades
are worse than any forest. If he gets off
the firm ground he’ll sink down in the swamp and
never be able to get out. Boys, I wish the professor
was safely back with us. But there’s no
help for it now, and all we can do is to wait. Perhaps
I’m too nervous and he may turn up all right,
but the attack on the camp looks bad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“Poor old professor!” murmured Ned. “I’d
hate to have anything happen to him.”</p>

<p>“So would I,” put in Bob, “but I guess, as
Jerry says, there’s nothing to be done but to
wait.”</p>

<p>The day seemed very long, for they were watching
for the return of the scientist. No one had
the heart to do anything, and the boys sat listlessly
about the camp, even Bob having a poor appetite
for his meals.</p>

<p>Toward afternoon Ned proposed that they take
their guns and a walk along the edge of the lake,
not going far away from camp.</p>

<p>“We might see something to shoot at,” he said.
“It will make the time pass quicker, and if there
are any negroes hiding about they’ll hear the guns
and know we’re on the watch.”</p>

<p>The plan was agreed to, and the boys tried several
shots at loons and alligators. Jerry succeeded
in wounding one of the big saurians, but the
creature buried itself in the mud and the boys
could not get it.</p>

<p>“We’ll take the boat to-morrow,” said Ned,
“and have a try at some of these big lizards. If
we could skin one or two we’d have some nice
hides to show for our trip.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me from skinning alligators,” remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Bob, making a wry face. “The weather
is too hot.”</p>

<p>As they started back for camp Bob espied a
bush laden with yellow fruit. He approached it
on the run.</p>

<p>“Just what I’ve been wishing for!” he exclaimed,
pulling off some and beginning to eat
them.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried Jerry. “What are those
things? They may be poison.”</p>

<p>“They’re mangoes,” answered Bob, eating his
second one.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” and Jerry looked doubtful.</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered the always-hungry
youth. “I’ve read about them and I know.”</p>

<p>“Better leave ’em alone,” advised Jerry.
“They may be the mango fruit, but I wouldn’t
take any chances. Besides, if they are mangoes,
this variety, from having grown in the everglades,
may be poisonous.”</p>

<p>“They don’t taste so,” remarked Bob, continuing
to eat the fruit, which smelled delicious and
had a fine appearance. “Better have some,
Ned.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks. Camp stuff is good enough for
me when I’m not sure of what the other is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob continued to enjoy himself on the fruit,
which certainly was tempting. He only laughed
at the warnings of his companions, and filled his
pockets with the yellow things, a number of which
he took back to camp.</p>

<p>In accordance with the plan of the previous
night, the boys maintained a watch. The fish-line
alarm was set again, and with a lantern burning
down near the boat, where it would disclose any
persons who might try to sneak up and cut the
mooring lines, Ned and Jerry prepared to turn in.
It was Bob’s turn to stand first watch. The boys
had not lost their uneasy feeling concerning the
professor, and they hoped every moment to hear
his cheery hail as he returned.</p>

<p>“Don’t you wish you’d brought some of the
mangoes?” asked Bob of his chums, producing
some of the yellow fruit as he prepared to begin
his tour of duty. “This will keep me awake.”</p>

<p>“Call us at the slightest sign of danger,” cautioned
Jerry, as he went inside the tent.</p>

<p>It seemed that he and Ned had been sleeping
but a short time when they were suddenly aroused
by Bob shaking them.</p>

<p>“What is it? The negroes again?” asked
Jerry as he sat up and grabbed his gun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” replied Bob in a faint voice. “Oh,
Jerry, I’m awful sick! I guess it was those mangoes.
I can hardly stand! Can’t you do something
for me?”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>JERRY SEEKS AID</small></h2>


<p>Jerry was up in an instant and soon lit a lantern.
By the glimmer of it he saw that Bob was
indeed a very sick youth. The lad’s face was
flushed, his hands were cold and clammy and his
face and head were hot with a burning fever. His
eyes had an unnaturally bright look, his breath
came fast, and in short gasps.</p>

<p>“Why Bob!” exclaimed Ned. “What is the
matter?”</p>

<p>“It came on me suddenly,” said the unfortunate
lad, sitting down on the ground in the tent. “I
was going to eat some more of the mangoes when,
all at once, I was seized with a fit of trembling.”</p>

<p>As he spoke a series of tremors shook his body,
and he seemed about to fall over. Jerry caught
him.</p>

<p>“Quick, Ned!” he exclaimed. “Help me get
Bob to bed. Then we’ll see what we can do.”</p>

<p>They undressed Bob, who continued to shake
and shiver for he had a chill alternating with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
fever. Then, while Jerry and Ned were worrying
over the matter and pondering what to do, the
poor lad’s temperature suddenly went up and he
was in a higher fever.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to do something to bring that
down,” remarked Jerry. “What did they give
you when you were sick, Ned?” and Jerry looked
at his chum.</p>

<p>“It’s so long since I was sick I’ve forgotten,”
was the answer. “Have we any medicine at
all?”</p>

<p>“Mother made me bring some quinine along,
and a few other things, like witch hazel and sticking
plaster, but I don’t believe any of them are
good for fevers. I’ll look in the box.”</p>

<p>Jerry proceeded to investigate the small case of
simple remedies his mother had packed, but which
had never been opened. The chums were seldom
ill, and when they were they usually let nature adjust
itself. But they realized that something must
be done for Bob.</p>

<p>“‘Spirits of nitre,’” read Ned from the label
of one of the bottles. “Say, Jerry, this is the stuff
for fevers. I remember my mother used to use it
when I was a little chap. Let’s give him some.”</p>

<p>Jerry read the label on the bottle. The nitre,
according to the directions, was good for fevers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and they decided to give Bob a larger dose than
was called for, as they had an idea the stuff was
for children, and that a full grown youth would
need more.</p>

<p>Anxiously they waited for the remedy to have
some effect. Every now and then they would
place their hands on Bob’s head or wrist to note
the warmth of his body. To their worriment he
seemed to be getting hotter instead of cooler.
The fever indeed was rising fast and poor Bob
was in a bad way.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t seem to be strong enough,” said Jerry
after three hours of dreary watching. They had
dressed and sat in the tent which was dimly lighted
by a lantern.</p>

<p>“Let’s give him some more,” Ned suggested.</p>

<p>Another dose was administered, though Bob
fought against taking it. The youth was hardly
conscious of what he was doing. He lay with
closed eyes, his face red and flushed from the fever,
and his breath coming in short, labored gasps.</p>

<p>Suddenly the sick boy raised himself up on the
cot where he had been placed.</p>

<p>“There he is!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Jerry, thinking Bob saw some
one.</p>

<p>“That alligator! He has the big snake and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
they are both being chased by the sea cow!
Where’s my gun?”</p>

<p>“Out of his head,” whispered Ned, as he gently
pressed Bob back on the bed. “What shall we
do?”</p>

<p>Jerry did not know what to say. This was a
new complication, for their journeys heretofore
had been free from the worry of serious illness.</p>

<p>“My, but he’s hot!” went on Ned, feeling of
Bob’s hand. “We ought to have an ice bag for
him.”</p>

<p>“No ice here, but I’ve just thought of something
we can do.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Dip cloths in water and put ’em on him.
That’ll help some.”</p>

<p>“Good idea.”</p>

<p>They dipped several large handkerchiefs into
the lake, wrung them out, and laid them on Bob’s
forehead, neck and chest. It was a crude expedient
but it was the best they could do. In the hot
climate the water evaporated quickly and the cloths
were made cooler from this cause than they otherwise
would have been. Bob seemed a little easier,
though he continued to moan and murmur in his
delirium.</p>

<p>It was a long, weary night and, when the gray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
dawn began to show, Ned and Jerry were two very
much alarmed youths.</p>

<p>“If the professor would only come back!” exclaimed
Ned. “He’d know what to do for Bob.
He always carries medicine with him. I wish he
would come.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he left some of his medicines in the
boat.”</p>

<p>“If he did I wouldn’t risk using them. We
might give Bob the wrong thing.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. I wonder if anything could have
happened to Mr. Snodgrass?”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” responded Ned. “Still he ought
to be back by this time.”</p>

<p>“Give me some ice water!” suddenly called
Bob, sitting up on the cot.</p>

<p>“I wish we had some,” said Jerry in a low voice
as he gently pushed his chum’s head back on the
pillow. “He’s on fire,” he added, turning to
Ned.</p>

<p>“Give him some more nitre.”</p>

<p>The medicine was administered with considerable
difficulty for, as the fever progressed Bob
fought against taking it, as the stuff was not very
pleasant. Still Ned and Jerry knew it was the
only thing they had, and they fairly forced Bob
to swallow it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>The day was worse than the night, though at
times the patient dozed and was quiet. The two
youths listened for every sound that might indicate
the return of the professor but he did not
come. It grew hotter and hotter and then it began
to rain.</p>

<p>With the storm came a cloud of mosquitoes that
made life miserable for the boys. It was stifling
to stay in the tent, yet that was their only refuge.
They had mosquito netting, and this kept out the
most of the pests, but Ned and Jerry had to make
frequent trips to the lake for fresh water, and on
these occasions the insects pitched on them with
great violence.</p>

<p>Bob grew worse, and the two watchers were
much alarmed. They did not know what to do.
They only had a little of the nitre left and it did
not seem to be doing any good. The truth was
Bob needed a much stronger remedy than that
which the boys had.</p>

<p>All day long the rain fell and the next night was
one of the worst the boys had ever put in. They
took turns sitting up with Bob who continually
cried for ice water when there was none to be had.
Ned and Jerry lived on cold victuals. As for Bob
he only sipped a little water now and then.</p>

<p>“Do you think he’ll die?” asked Ned in gloomy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
accents, as Jerry awoke to take his turn at watching.</p>

<p>“No! Of course not. What makes you think
that?”</p>

<p>“Because he doesn’t seem to get any better.”</p>

<p>“He can’t get better at once. I think it was
that yellow fruit he ate which has made him sick.
You and I didn’t take any and we’re all right.”</p>

<p>“Then Bob is poisoned.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so. Still this may be the worst of
it. As long as he has gotten along so far, with
nothing more than a high fever, I’m sure he’ll pull
through.”</p>

<p>But the fever was bad enough. Bob began to
weaken under the attack. The second day he
could not raise himself in bed. He reclined there
with closed eyes and his breathing was more labored.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t the professor come!” exclaimed
Ned.</p>

<p>“I tell you what I believe!” exclaimed Jerry.
“Mr. Snodgrass is being detained by those negroes!”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?”</p>

<p>“I do. I believe they had a plot to get possession
of all our things. We scared off those who
came to the camp but the others have Mr. Snodgrass
a captive, I’m sure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“What are we going to do? If Bob doesn’t
get some other medicine soon&mdash;he’ll die.”</p>

<p>“I know what I’m going to do!” said Jerry in
determined tones.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to find the professor!”</p>

<p>“How can you?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to follow that little stream,” and
Jerry pointed to the one up which the scientist had
journeyed in the canoe with the negroes.</p>

<p>“But you have no boat. The <i>Dartaway</i> draws
too much to take up that creek.”</p>

<p>“I know it. I’m going to walk. I see there
is a sort of path along the edge of the stream.
I’m going to see where it leads to. I may not find
the professor, but I’ll try and find some one who
can help us. Maybe I can run across a band of
Indians and get some of their remedies. If only
Ottiby was here he’d be able to give Bob something
to make him well. Will you be afraid to stay here
alone with Bob, Ned?”</p>

<p>“No, of course not. But hurry back. There’s
no telling what may happen.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bring the professor back with me, or some
medicine for Bob,” said Jerry, as he prepared for
his journey.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>THE RECEDING WATER</small></h2>


<p>Jerry started off early the next morning. The
rain had ceased but there was a thick fog and, because
of the moist vegetation of the tropics, water
fairly dripped from the trees, festooned as they
were with long streamers of moss and vines.</p>

<p>“I hate to leave you, Ned,” Jerry remarked as
he shouldered his gun and put some bread and
pieces of bacon into his pocket. “But it can’t be
helped. I’ll try and get back by night, even if I
don’t find the professor.”</p>

<p>“Do the best you can, Jerry. I’ll look after
Bob.”</p>

<p>It was with no small sense of loneliness that Ned
watched Jerry disappear into the forest. The
trees soon hid him from sight and then Ned set
about getting the camp in some sort of order, for
they had rather neglected it of late. Bob turned
and tossed on his couch. The fever still burned
within him but he was much weaker and did not
need to be so closely watched. For want of something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
better Ned administered more nitre, and Bob
no longer fought against taking it.</p>

<p>“Poor Bob!” said Ned with a sigh. “I’d
rather you’d kick up a fuss. I’d know then you
had some life left in you.”</p>

<p>But Bob meekly swallowed the mixture, and
when Ned took his arm from under his chum’s
head it fell back listlessly on the pillow.</p>

<p>Ned thought the day would never end. He
had not the heart to cook anything and ate the remainder
of the cold food. He sat in front of the
tent gloomily looking at the lake and wondering
whether Jerry would find the professor.</p>

<p>Now and then Bob would call out but when Ned
hurried in he would find his chum murmuring in
delirium. All he could do was to wet the fever-parched
lips with water, and renew the damp
cloths on the sufferer’s head and chest.</p>

<p>“Poor Bob,” said Ned with a sigh. “I wish
you hadn’t eaten that strange fruit.”</p>

<p>As the afternoon wore away Ned listened anxiously
for the sound of Jerry’s returning footsteps.
For want of something better to do to while away
the time he began cleaning the engine of the <i>Dartaway</i>.</p>

<p>It was while doing this that he happened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
look at the edge of the lake. Something queer
about it attracted his attention.</p>

<p>“If I didn’t know differently,” he said to himself,
“I’d say the tide was falling. It looks
just as if the water was lower.”</p>

<p>Feeling sure that such a thing was impossible,
Ned went on working at the engine. A little later
he again gazed over the side of the boat. This
time he started in surprise.</p>

<p>“I’m positive that stone wasn’t so far out of
water the last time I looked,” he said, speaking
aloud. “I wonder if this lake can be connected
with the ocean in some manner, and is affected by
the tide? No, it can’t be, or we’d have noticed
it before. Yet the water is surely running away.”</p>

<p>He got out of the <i>Dartaway</i>. He was much
alarmed to see that nearly half of the craft was
now out of the lake, whereas a while before only
the bow-end had rested on the sandy beach.</p>

<p>“The lake is surely lowering,” Ned went on.
“I must watch and see how fast it is falling.”</p>

<p>He marked where the water came on shore and
sat down to wait. He was too much worried to
be able to go on working. Bob called, and he
went in to see what was wanted. He gave his
chum a drink and administered some more medicine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
He was in the tent a half hour, and when
he came out he was surprised to see that the water
was half an inch from the mark.</p>

<p>“It’s falling at the rate of an inch an hour,”
said Ned. “This is getting serious. I wish Jerry
and the professor would come back.”</p>

<p>Ned watched the lake. There was no mistake
about it, the water was slowly falling. More and
more of the <i>Dartaway’s</i> keel was exposed.</p>

<p>“This’ll never do!” exclaimed Ned. “In a
short time the boat will be aground and we’ll have
a hard time getting it afloat again. I must shove
it further into the lake.”</p>

<p>He tried to do it but found the task was beyond
his strength. Pull, push and tug as he did he
could not stir the boat. The stern, with the screw,
was still in deep water and he started the engine
on the reverse, hoping to be able to have the craft
move out further into the lake under its own power.
But though the propeller churned the water
the craft did not budge.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” remarked Ned. “I’ll have to
wait until Jerry and the professor come back. I
wonder what makes the water flow away? It
can’t be the tide.”</p>

<p>He was much puzzled, and the more he thought
of it the more he was alarmed. Suppose the lake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
should suddenly go dry? It would be impossible
to get the <i>Dartaway</i> to Lake Okeechobee in that
case and they would have to abandon the craft in
the everglades. Worse than that they would
have hard work in leaving Florida, as they were
in an uninhabited part.</p>

<p>“We certainly are up against it!” exclaimed
Ned, as he shut off the engine after his fruitless attempt.
“What in the world am I going to do?”</p>

<p>There was no one to answer his question, and
once more he sat down despondently in front of the
tent and gazed at the receding water.</p>

<p>It was beginning to get dusk and Ned knew it
would soon be dark as there was practically no
twilight in this semi-tropical land.</p>

<p>“I wish Jerry would come back,” he murmured.
“I don’t like the idea of staying here alone with
Bob all night.”</p>

<p>He went into the tent to give the patient a drink.
As he was coming out he heard the crackling of
underbrush. It indicated the approach of some
one. Ned hurried to the flap of the tent. He
saw through the semi-darkness a figure approaching.</p>

<p>“Jerry!” he called.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s me, Ned. How’s Bob?”</p>

<p>“No better. Did you find the professor?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“No. I went as far as I could. The path
ended in a deep swamp and I couldn’t see any way
to get across. I had to come back. Is everything
all right?”</p>

<p>“No, Jerry. I’m afraid we’re in for a streak
of bad luck.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“Butterfly Lake is lowering.”</p>

<p>“The lake lowering! What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know myself. Either it’s connected
with the ocean and the tide is falling, or the bottom
has dropped out.”</p>

<p>“This lake isn’t connected with the tide.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s a leak in it.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Take a look.”</p>

<p>The two youths hurried down to the edge of the
water. Ned pointed to the <i>Dartaway</i>. The water
had receded so much that the propellor was
part way out.</p>

<p>“You know how it was when we left it,” said
Ned. “Now look at it. I tried to get the boat
off into deeper water but I couldn’t. Queer, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“More than queer,” responded Jerry in tired
accents, for he was very weary. “This is serious,
Ned. We’ll have to do something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“Better have something to eat first,” suggested
Ned. “You’re played out. I’ll make some coffee.”</p>

<p>He lighted the fire and soon had some of the
steaming beverage ready. He took some and so
did Jerry. Then they looked at Bob. The poor
chap was no better, but the boys were a little encouraged
that he was no worse.</p>

<p>“He’s holding his own,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, but if the fever doesn’t break up soon
he’ll&mdash;”</p>

<p>Jerry didn’t finish, and Ned did not ask him
what he meant.</p>

<p>“The nitre is all gone,” went on Ned. “I
don’t know what to give him now.”</p>

<p>“We’ll bathe him in witch hazel,” suggested
Jerry. “That has alcohol in it, and I’ve heard
that’s what they wash fever patients in. It may
do him some good.”</p>

<p>Bob did seem a little more comfortable after
Ned and Jerry had sponged him with the witch
hazel, of which they had a large bottle. But the
fever was soon raging again, and poor Bob tossed
more restlessly than before, while he murmured in
his delirium of ice water and other cooling drinks.</p>

<p>Morning came at last. As soon as it was light
Jerry hurried down to the lake. What he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
caused him to cry out in surprise. The <i>Dartaway</i>
was now ten feet from the edge.</p>

<p>“There’s only thing to do!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get the boat into the deep water.
Otherwise it will soon be so far away we can’t float
her.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to do it?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to cut down some small trees for
rollers and edge it along that way.”</p>

<p>“But what about Bob?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to put him on board first.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>THE PROFESSOR RETURNS</small></h2>


<p>Urged on by the seriousness of their plight, the
two boys lost no time in getting to work. With
small axes which formed a part of their camp accessories
they chopped down several palmetto trees.
They were of soft wood and easy to work. Ned
and Jerry soon had several rollers made.</p>

<p>These were placed in position to slide the boat
on them into the lake, which kept receding.</p>

<p>“How we going to get back into Lake Okeechobee,”
asked Ned. “The connecting river must
be dried up by this time.”</p>

<p>“Probably it is, but we’ve got to get the <i>Dartaway</i>
afloat now or never. We’ll have to take our
chances on getting out of here.”</p>

<p>Before rolling the boat down into the receding
water the awning was put up and a bunk gotten
ready for Bob. Then he was carried down into
it. He was too sick to know or care what was going
on.</p>

<p>“Now for some hard work,” remarked Jerry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
as he and Ned got ready to move the <i>Dartaway</i>.</p>

<p>They found it a difficult task. More than once
they felt like giving up but they knew they must
proceed if they were to have the use of their craft.
It took them almost half a day to accomplish it.
They used long branches of trees for levers and,
inch by inch the motor boat was shoved astern until
the propellor dipped once more into the lake.</p>

<p>“Almost done!” exclaimed Ned with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Yes, thank goodness,” echoed Jerry.</p>

<p>Half an hour more of work and the craft floated.
The boys brought their camp stuff and packed
it into the boat, striking the tent since they could
no longer remain on shore so far away from the
water. Fortunately the falling of the lake left exposed
a hard shell beach instead of a lot of soft
mud, or the boys would never have been able to
make trips back and forth with their camping accessories.</p>

<p>“Now what?” asked Ned as they sat in the
boat.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to wait here, or in this neighborhood,
for the professor,” said Jerry. “He’s liable
to come back at any minute.”</p>

<p>“If he comes back at all!”</p>

<p>“It does look bad,” admitted Jerry, in answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
to Ned’s gloomy words. “But I guess he can
take care of himself.”</p>

<p>“Those negroes are ugly customers,” said Ned.
“I wish we could come across Mr. Seabury again.
He might be able to suggest a plan.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’ll not see him in a hurry. He
can’t get to us and we can’t get to him with the
river that connected the two lakes all dried up. I
wonder what caused this sudden falling away of
the water?”</p>

<p>“You’ve got me,” replied Ned. “I’ve puzzled
over it until I can’t think straight. But let’s cruise
about a bit. It’s hot and we may strike a breeze
out on the lake. Perhaps we can find the outlet
through which the water is all disappearing.”</p>

<p>To this plan Jerry agreed. It was much cooler
with the boat swiftly in motion, and Bob seemed
to feel easier. Now and then he would rouse up
and ask some question, but, before his chums could
answer he would again sink into the stupor of
fever. The boat was sent in a wide circle of the
lake. It was so large that it did not seem to have
grown appreciably smaller when the chums looked
at it some distance from shore. But once the beach
was approached the appearance of rocks that had
long been under water told the story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“We don’t want to go very far away from
where we were camped,” said Jerry. “It would
be too bad if the professor should come back and
not find us. We must keep within sight of where
we were.”</p>

<p>They passed the afternoon cruising about in
sight of where they had last seen Mr. Snodgrass.
When it grew dark, lanterns were lighted and hung
about the boat.</p>

<p>“He can see them from shore and hail us,” remarked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Hark!” cried Bob, suddenly sitting up in his
bunk. “My mother is calling me! I’m coming!”
he cried and began throwing off the light
covering which Jerry had placed over him.</p>

<p>“His mind is wandering,” said Ned as he hurried
to his chum’s side. “He fancies he hears
some one calling.”</p>

<p>At that moment there came a voice from out of
the darkness. A voice sounding far away.</p>

<p>“Boys! Where are you?” came across the
water.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“The professor!” exclaimed Ned. “It’s his
voice!”</p>

<p>Jerry sprang to the engine and set it in motion.</p>

<p>“We’re coming!” yelled Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry opened the muffler and the sound of the
motor’s explosions sounded loud on the still night.</p>

<p>“He’ll hear that better than he will our shouts,”
he remarked, as he steered the boat toward where
the camp had been.</p>

<p>Bob grew quieter as the motion of the boat
soothed him. In a short time the craft was close
enough to shore, for the professor’s voice to be
plainly heard.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he called.</p>

<p>“Bottom dropped out of the lake,” cried Ned,
giving his favorite reason for the strange action
of the water. “We’ll come as close as we can.
Are you all right?”</p>

<p>“Fairly so,” answered Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>He was soon aboard and, in a few words, the
boys told him what had happened since he went
away.</p>

<p>“Bob sick!” the scientist exclaimed. “Let
me look at him. I have some medicine among my
things.”</p>

<p>By the light of a lantern Mr. Snodgrass examined
Bob. He seemed grave when he had finished
and at once began searching among his boxes.</p>

<p>“Is he&mdash;is he very bad?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” was the reply. “The fever
has been allowed to run too long. You did the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
best you could, but the medicine you had was not
strong enough. What I have will hardly answer
but it is the best I can do. It may break up the
fever. I’ll try it at any rate.”</p>

<p>The professor soon had a dose mixed and gave
it to Bob. In a little while the lad’s breathing was
easier, and he seemed to be sleeping more naturally.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it will do,” said the scientist, as he
felt of the patient’s pulse.</p>

<p>“Now tell us about yourself,” urged Ned.
“We were very anxious about you. What happened?”</p>

<p>“Well, I had rather a narrow escape. Mr.
Seabury was right about those scoundrels. They
wanted to rob me, and had no intention of leading
me to where I could find the rare butterfly. I discovered
this when it came night and they said it
was two days’ journey further on. I wanted to
come back, as I knew you would be worried, but
they acted so ugly I thought I had better do as they
wished. I stayed with them in a rude camp they
made, but I didn’t go to sleep. I heard something
which made me think they might attack you boys.”</p>

<p>“They did but we drove ’em off,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Good for you! Well, I insisted on being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
led to the butterflies the next day, but they kept
making excuses. Finally I managed to get away
by a trick and I started for our camp.</p>

<p>“I lost my way and had to spend another night
in the everglades. Fortunately I had my compass
with me and I had taken note of the general direction
we traveled in. There are some trails
through the everglades and I managed to follow
them. At last I struck the one along the stream
on which they had taken me in their canoe and I
knew I was safe. But I didn’t get my butterfly.
Now what is this about the falling lake?”</p>

<p>The boys told him, and Mr. Snodgrass looked
worried. He could not explain the phenomenon,
but said they would make an investigation in the
morning.</p>

<p>In spite of his weariness the scientist insisted on
sitting up that night with Bob. The boat was
anchored well off from shore but near enough to
be pulled in by a rope and in the morning Bob was
much better though very weak.</p>

<p>“I think he’ll come around,” remarked the professor.
“I’d like a different kind of medicine for
him, but perhaps we can find Mr. Seabury and his
houseboat. He has quite a stock of drugs, he told
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“We can’t get to him unless we find another
outlet of the lake,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Very well, then we’ll look for one,” answered
Uriah Snodgrass. “Let’s make a tour of this
body of water.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>IN THE FLOATING FOREST</small></h2>


<p>Putting into operation the suggestion of the
professor the boys started the <i>Dartaway</i> off after
breakfast on a tour of the lake. The day was
cloudy and there was a stiff breeze which kicked
up something of a sea, but the motor craft was able
to weather heavier waves than any the boys encountered.</p>

<p>“There must be an outlet to account for the water
flowing away,” remarked the professor, as they
speeded along. Bob continued to improve slightly
though he was far from well. His delirium had
left him, however, and he was very weak.</p>

<p>They traveled many miles around the shores of
the lake but discovered nothing in the way of an
outlet. The water seemed to be lowering rapidly.</p>

<p>“This is getting serious,” remarked the professor
as he closely scanned the surface of the lake.
“We’ve got to do something.”</p>

<p>“The question is&mdash;what?” said Ned.</p>

<p>“We had better go a little farther,” continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the scientist. “Then if we do not discover something,
we’ll camp for the night. In the morning
we may have better luck.”</p>

<p>It was well along in the afternoon now and Jerry,
who was at the wheel, speeded up the engine to
send the craft ahead faster in order to cover as
much of the lake as possible. But no explanation
of the phenomenon rewarded the efforts of the
travelers.</p>

<p>“That looks like a good place to camp,” said
Jerry, pointing ahead to a clump of forest. The
shores were of sloping gravel and the receding
water has not left exposed a lot of mud. “We
can’t do better than to put up there,” he added.</p>

<p>“Are we going ashore?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I think it will be wise,” replied Uriah Snodgrass.
“Bob is restless in the narrow bunk and
he needs a change.”</p>

<p>The sick boy had dozed off and took no part in
the discussion.</p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> was headed for the place Jerry
had indicated, and in a short time the travelers
were ashore with Ned and Jerry making camp and
erecting the tent, while the professor looked after
Bob. The boat was moored by a long rope some
distance from shore as they did not want to find it
aground in the morning in case the waters should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
continue to recede. They could wade out to it, as
the shore was sloping.</p>

<p>Bob did seem a little better when placed on a
comfortable cot in the tent. However, he took no
interest in what was going on but lay with closed
eyes, for the fever still burned in his veins in spite
of the medicine administered by the professor.</p>

<p>“I must get something stronger for Bob,” he
said. “If I was near a drug store I would have
no trouble, but out here I’m afraid I can find nothing
that will completely break the high fever. If
I met our old Indian friend he might be able to
suggest to me some vegetable remedy.”</p>

<p>“We’d better made everything doubly secure to-night,”
remarked Jerry as they prepared to retire.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Because there’s going to be a storm, and, if
I’m not much mistaken, a tough one.”</p>

<p>Indeed it did look as though Jerry’s prophecy
was likely to be fulfilled. The sun had long since
sunk down behind a bank of ominous looking
clouds, and now a fitful wind was springing up,
sighing through the palmetto trees and swaying
the long streamers of vines like big pendulums.
Whenever the wind died away momentarily there
was a curious hush over everything, that magnified
slight sounds. It grew darker but with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
a peculiar yellow cast that gave objects a sickly hue.</p>

<p>“We’re in for a heavy blow,” remarked the professor.
“Look well to the guy ropes, boys.”</p>

<p>They needed no urging, but set to with a will,
the scientist helping them, to make their camp secure.
As the hours went by, and the signs of the
storm did not increase, they had hopes that it
might pass away.</p>

<p>Ned and the professor stretched themselves out
on their cots while Jerry, who had agreed to take
first watch, sat just outside the tent watching the
fitful play of lightning in the western sky.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s coming after all,” he said to himself
as the flashes grew more brilliant. Now and
then low mutterings of thunder could be heard, and
the wind, which, for the last half hour had died
away, suddenly sprang up with an increased violence.</p>

<p>Suddenly there sounded a shrill shrieking as
though some gigantic whistle had been blown. So
startling was it that Jerry sprang to his feet thinking
that, in some unaccountable way, a steamer
had gotten on Butterfly Lake. But an instant
later he knew it was the hurricane, for the force of
it nearly blew the tent over.</p>

<p>“All hands to help hold things down!” yelled
Jerry, springing to a guy rope as the canvas undulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
under the force of the powerful wind.</p>

<p>Fortunately Ned and the professor were light
sleepers. They sprang up and went to Jerry’s assistance.
The tent seemed determined to give in
to the wind and collapse, but the three held on until
the first fury of the blast had passed by. It settled
down to a heavy blow but the ropes held.
Then with a dash of stinging globules the rain
came, and the storm was fairly on. The three
outside the tent were drenched in an instant, and
hastened inside.</p>

<p>Bob had awakened from the noise of the tempest.
He sat up, half frightened, but when Jerry
assured him everything was safe he turned over
and dozed off again, so powerful a hold did the
fever have on him.</p>

<p>It was a night such as the travelers had seldom
experienced on any of their journeys, and they had
been in some tight places. There was almost a
continuous rattle and roar of thunder and the lightning
was incessant. Mingled with the rain was
the boom of the lake waves on the shore, for the
wind kicked up quite a disturbance on the large
body of water.</p>

<p>“I hope our boat’s safe,” remarked Jerry as
there sounded a fiercer burst of the storm.</p>

<p>It seemed as if morning would never come but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
at last there was a perceptible lifting of the darkness
and the storm seemed to abate some. Ned
put on an oil-skin coat, and, donning a pair of rubber
boots, ventured out. No sooner had he
emerged from the tent than he gave a shout which
brought the professor and Jerry to the tent flap.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“We’re adrift!”</p>

<p>“Adrift! What do you mean? We’re not on
the boat!”</p>

<p>“No, but we’re on something that’s floating.
Look over there at those trees on shore and you
can see that we’re moving!”</p>

<p>Jerry and the professor looked. Getting two
tall trees in range they could easily note that they
were moving, as the position of the trees changed
with reference to themselves.</p>

<p>“What could have happened?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“We must have landed on an island instead of
on the mainland,” said Ned. “In some way the
island got adrift.”</p>

<p>“I think we landed on the main land all right,”
said Uriah Snodgrass, “but what happened was
this: These everglades are not much more than
floating masses of vegetation, several feet thick it
is true, and capable of supporting large trees. But
the fury of the storm probably cut off from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
main land the portion we’re on. It floated off and
took us with it. We’re in the middle of the lake.”</p>

<p>“Where’s our boat?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Back where you moored it, probably, unless it
has also drifted with us,” replied Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“Then we’re in for a lot of trouble,” exclaimed
Ned. “What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“We’d better make some explorations,” suggested
the professor. “It’s stopped raining.
We’ll try and discover how large our island is.”</p>

<p>They looked to see that Bob was comfortable,
and found him sleeping. Placing some water
where he could reach it, the three set off expecting
to be back in half an hour or so.</p>

<p>Through the woods they went, seeking to get
to the other side of the floating island to look for
their boat. It was hard work tramping through
the underbrush, and they needed all the protection
which their heavy oil-skin coats and rubber boots
gave them. On and on they went, taking little
heed of direction, for they were all anxious and
worried.</p>

<p>But the island seemed very large. They had
left the shores and were well into the interior. It
was dark and gloomy for the sky was overcast.
Suddenly the professor called:</p>

<p>“Boys, let’s halt a minute.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned and Jerry stopped. They looked at their
companion.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’ve done rather a foolish thing,”
he said. “Have either of you a compass?”</p>

<p>The boys said they had not.</p>

<p>“Neither have I,” went on Mr. Snodgrass.
“I left mine in the tent. We should have been
more careful. I don’t know in what direction we
are going, nor which way to go back. This island
is larger than I thought.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we’re lost?” asked Ned, in some
alarm.</p>

<p>“Yes, boys, it looks very much as though we
were lost in a floating forest, and I think we’ll have
trouble in getting back to camp.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>A CRY FOR HELP</small></h2>


<p>With anxious faces the travelers looked at one
another. The alarm caused by the discovery that
they were on a floating island made them forget
their usual caution. Even so seasoned a tourist as
Uriah Snodgrass had been at fault, and he did not
cease to blame himself for it.</p>

<p>“We’ll do the best we can,” he said. “This
is more my fault than any one else's, as I proposed
it in such a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we follow our trail back?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“We can try, but I fancy we wandered over
rather a crooked one.”</p>

<p>This they found to be true. They managed to
follow their tracks for some distance but soon lost
the trail amid the trees and dense underbrush.</p>

<p>They had come off without breakfast and the
pangs of hunger began to make themselves manifest.
As for the professor, once the first shock of
being lost had passed, he became so much interested
in catching some curious bugs that he paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
little attention to the boys. However, they kept
him in sight, for it would not do to become separated
in this dense forest.</p>

<p>“If we’d only told Bob to fire a gun or do something
in case we didn’t return soon,” remarked Ned
with a sigh. “Poor Bob! I wish we were back
where he is.”</p>

<p>“No use wishing,” spoke up Jerry. “We’ve
got to keep on. Maybe we’ll hit the trail soon.”</p>

<p>On and on they wandered but only, it seemed, to
get the more hopelessly lost. The two boys were
much alarmed, but the scientist, his whole mind
given over to collecting bugs, was somewhat indifferent.</p>

<p>“Hark! What was that?” cried Ned suddenly.</p>

<p>“Sounded like a gun,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“It was a gun,” replied Ned. “It was over
this way,” and he pointed to the left. “Come on.
Maybe it’s a party of hunters.”</p>

<p>Calling to the professor, the boys turned in the
direction from which the report had come. They
had not gone far before another gun shot was
heard and they knew they were in the right direction,
but toward whom they were going they did
know.</p>

<p>“Anyway it’s some person or persons,” argued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Ned. “We can help them or they can help us.
We’ll have company if we are lost.”</p>

<p>The gun continued to be fired at intervals and
but for this the three would not have known how
to proceed. The reports sound very close now and
in about ten minutes the two boys and the professor
saw something white glimmering before them
in the light of the sun that was just breaking
through the clouds.</p>

<p>“There’s the lake! There’s water! We’re
on the shore!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>A few moments later they had emerged from
the dense forest and saw before them their own
tent with Bob at the entrance loading and firing
his rifle.</p>

<p>“Good boy!” cried Ned. “How did you
think to do it, old chap? How are you?”</p>

<p>“I was worried when I found you all gone,”
said the invalid. “I thought you might have
gone off in the woods and, as I looked out of the
tent I thought I saw the land moving. That
scared me and I got up. I feared I was on a floating
island so I fired the gun to call you back as I
didn’t know what had happened while you were
away.”</p>

<p>“You’re on a floating island all right,” remarked
Jerry. “We got lost in the woods, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
for some way out of the difficulty, and your
firing gave us the right direction.”</p>

<p>“How do you feel, Bob?” asked the professor.</p>

<p>“A little better, I think.”</p>

<p>But Bob’s flushed face and unnaturally bright
eye did not bear out this statement.</p>

<p>“You had better go back to bed,” decided Mr.
Snodgrass. “I’ll give you some more medicine.
I think you are getting a touch of malaria mixed
with your fever.”</p>

<p>The exertion of getting out of bed and firing
the gun had greatly weakened Bob and he was
much worse. They ate a hurried breakfast, and
the professor gave the patient some more medicine.</p>

<p>“We ought to look for our boat,” said Ned.
“If we lose that it’s all up with us. Suppose we
walk along shore. We may get a sight of it.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” agreed Uriah Snodgrass. “I’ll
stay here with Bob and you and Jerry can move in
opposite directions. You can’t get lost if you follow
the shore and the one who first sights the boat
can fire three shots and they will call the other to
him.”</p>

<p>Ned and Jerry agreed that this was a good plan
and started off. Ned walked quickly along the
shore, keeping a watch for the <i>Dartaway</i> but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
sight of her did not reward his eyes. As he was
proceeding, having tramped for over two hours,
he heard a noise in the bushes just ahead of him
where a little point of land jutted out into the
lake.</p>

<p>“Some one is coming,” reasoned the lad, holding
his gun in readiness as he thought of the ugly
negroes.</p>

<p>An instant later a figure came into view. Ned
started as he caught sight of it. He could not see
it distinctly but he observed a gun barrel. Then
he had a glimpse of a red cap.</p>

<p>“Jerry!” he called. “Is that you?”</p>

<p>“That’s who it is! I was just thinking I had
met an Indian or a colored man. See anything of
the boat?” and Jerry stepped from behind the
bushes and confronted his chum.</p>

<p>“Not a sign. Did you?”</p>

<p>“No, and between us, we completed the circuit
of the island. Must be about six miles around it.”</p>

<p>“No boat,” murmured Ned. “What are we
going to do?”</p>

<p>“Land only knows. This island is still floating,
and it seems to be continually moving in the
same general direction&mdash;that is south. Maybe
the boat is drifting also and we’ll catch up to her
or she will with us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope so. But we’d better go back now. I
hate to take bad news to the professor, though.”</p>

<p>There was no help for it, however, and soon the
two youths were tramping back toward camp.
The scientist was much disappointed that they had
not been successful, but he was more worried over
Bob’s condition.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid of the result if he doesn’t get different
medicine soon,” he said.</p>

<p>The day was a gloomy one in spite of the fine
weather that followed the storm. The campers
were in no mood for doing anything and sat about
listlessly, now and then taking an observation to
see how their island was behaving. It seemed to
be about in the middle of the big lake, though
moving slowly southward.</p>

<p>“It’s bound to fetch up somewhere,” observed
Ned.</p>

<p>“If it doesn’t strike some low place in the lake
and become anchored,” replied Jerry. “But I
don’t see that we can do anything. We might
swim off when it gets near the mainland, but we’ll
be in a bad way without our boat.”</p>

<p>There were uneasy sleepers in camp that night.
Early in the morning Ned and Jerry were up to
see if, by any chance, their boat had drifted near
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll take another tramp along shore,” proposed
Jerry.</p>

<p>Once more they started off. Jerry had gone
about two miles when he heard three shots
fired.</p>

<p>“That’s the signal!” he exclaimed. “Ned
must have sighted the <i>Dartaway</i>!”</p>

<p>He hurried back, passing through the camp and
telling the professor what he believed had happened.
Nor was he mistaken. He found Ned
pacing up and down the shore, stripped to his
underwear and ready to plunge into the lake.</p>

<p>“Do you see it?” called Jerry.</p>

<p>“Looks like her off there,” and Ned pointed to
a speck on the lake. “I’m going to swim out to
her.”</p>

<p>“Is it safe? There might be alligators or big
snakes.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to take a chance. We can never get
away from here without the boat. You watch me
and if you see anything that looks dangerous&mdash;why
shoot.”</p>

<p>Ned waded out into the water until he got to
his depth and then he began swimming. Jerry
anxiously watched for a sight of some big reptile
or saurian but his fears were groundless. In half
an hour Ned had reached the floating object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder if it’s the boat?” said Jerry to himself.</p>

<p>His question was answered a moment later for,
over the surface of the lake sounded the explosions
that told that Ned had started the engine of the
<i>Dartaway</i>.</p>

<p>In a short time the boat was close in shore.
Jerry waded out to her and then, in their recovered
craft, the chums headed for camp, where they
found the professor much delighted at their
success.</p>

<p>To avoid a repetition of the floating away of
the boat they tied her by a long rope to a tree close
to the tent. Then, in much better spirits, they sat
down to plan what next to do.</p>

<p>“I think we’d better all get into the boat and
hunt for the outlet of this lake,” said Mr. Snodgrass.
“There is no question but what the one
leading into Lake Okeechobee is closed. There
must be another or the water would not continue
to fall. I believe that&mdash;”</p>

<p>The professor’s belief was destined to remain
unannounced, for at that instant there sounded a
cry over the water.</p>

<p>“Help! Help! Help!”</p>

<p>“Those are girls’ voices!” remarked Jerry,
springing to his feet.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>THE PLIGHT OF THE GIRLS</small></h2>


<p>Once more over the water sounded the cry for
help. It was evident that several persons were
calling and, as the boys and the professor listened,
they found that the appeal came from around a
point of land that jutted out into the lake from
the floating island, not far from the camp.</p>

<p>“Get into the boat!” called Ned to Jerry, as
the latter hurried down to the shore. “We’ll
find ’em.”</p>

<p>The two were soon in the <i>Dartaway</i> and the
engine was started. As the motor craft moved
out of the little cove in front of camp the boys
saw before them three girls in a boat.</p>

<p>“Help us!” cried the young ladies.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“We’ve caught a big fish and it’s towing the
boat!”</p>

<p>“More likely an alligator!” exclaimed Ned.
“Put a little more speed on, Jerry. Why, if they
aren’t Mr. Seabury’s daughters! The houseboat
must be nearby!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure enough!” answered Jerry. “That’s
good news. We can get some medicine for Bob
now.”</p>

<p>Though the rowboat was moving at good speed
the <i>Dartaway</i> soon caught up to it. Ned and
Jerry saw three very much frightened girls who
waved their hands to them as the boys approached.</p>

<p>“They’re from the <i>Dartaway</i>!” cried Rose.
“I’m so glad to see them!”</p>

<p>“Quick!” exclaimed Olivia. “Something
has been towing us for an hour!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Ned, as he tried to peer
beneath the water.</p>

<p>“Oh, a terrible big fish,” answered Nellie.</p>

<p>In a few moments the rowboat was fast to the
motor craft and the smaller one came to a stop.
Then there was a flurry in the water just ahead,
and an ugly black snout was thrust up.</p>

<p>“An alligator!” exclaimed Jerry. He grabbed
for his gun and sent a bullet into the saurian.
A greater commotion beneath the surface of the
lake, which was tinged with red, showed that the
leaden missile had gone home.</p>

<p>“You killed him!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, but it wasn’t much of a kill,” responded
his chum as the alligator came to the surface, disclosing
the fact that it was a small one, only about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
five feet long. “Regular baby. How did you
girls come to get fast to it?”</p>

<p>“We didn’t. It got fast to us,” replied Olivia.
“Rose had baited a big hook on a stout line, expecting
to catch a shark I guess. We laughed at
her but she said she’d catch something with it.”</p>

<p>“And I did,” cried Rose. “I let it trail over
the side and the first thing I knew something took
my bait and hook and the boat began to move off.
We were scared to death.”</p>

<p>“How did you get here? Where is the houseboat?
We left you on Lake Okeechobee,” inquired
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this Lake Okeechobee?” asked Rose in
some alarm.</p>

<p>“We named it Butterfly Lake,” said Jerry, and
he told what had happened since they last visited
Mr. Seabury and his daughters.</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” said Rose. “We have been
cruising about on some lake, and we supposed it
was Lake Okeechobee. I noticed that we went
through quite a narrow place the other evening,
made a short circuit and returned to it, but I
thought nothing of it. We anchored the boat
near the passage and we’ve been there ever since
except to-day when we thought we’d go fishing.”</p>

<p>“Where is this narrow place you speak of; near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the one where we were?” asked Jerry, much interested.</p>

<p>“No, off that way,” and Rose pointed to the
south. “Our houseboat is there yet. We must
hurry back or father will be alarmed.”</p>

<p>“You must have found another outlet between
the two lakes,” was Jerry’s opinion. “That’s
just what we want as we can’t use the one we came
through, owing to the lowering of Butterfly Lake.
Have you noticed that?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Olivia. “Our boat was
nearly ashore. But father says these lakes frequently
get low in the summer time when there is
not much rain.”</p>

<p>“We’ve had enough rain for the last week or
so,” replied Ned. “However, no harm is done
if we can get back to Lake Okeechobee the way
you came into this lake. We’ll tow you back to
the place.”</p>

<p>The girls thought this was a good plan. They
inquired after the professor and Bob, and were
sorry to learn of the latter’s illness.</p>

<p>“I’m sure father has some medicine that would
make him better,” said Nellie. “He has a regular
drug store aboard the <i>Wanderer</i>. Did the
professor get his wonderful butterfly?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” replied Jerry and he related the scientist’s
experience with the ugly negroes.</p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i>, towing the rowboat, was headed
back toward where the girls said their houseboat
lay. As they passed the camp Jerry called to the
professor to let him know where they were going,
and promising to ask Mr. Seabury for a list of the
medicines he had so that the professor might select
some for Bob.</p>

<p>“Now you girls will have to tell us which way
to steer,” suggested Ned, when they had been
puffing along for some distance. “How far did
that alligator tow you?”</p>

<p>“It seemed like fifty miles,” replied Rose with
a laugh.</p>

<p>“It was about an hour,” said Olivia, with more
regard for correct details.</p>

<p>“Then we ought to be there soon,” declared
Jerry. “That alligator wasn’t going very fast.”</p>

<p>“There’s the place!” suddenly exclaimed Nellie.
“I remember it by the three dead trees on
a little point of land,” and she indicated where she
meant.</p>

<p>Jerry headed the <i>Dartaway</i> in that direction.
He scanned the shore, which they were approaching,
for a sight of an outlet from Butterfly Lake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
As he drew nearer he could see nothing that looked
like a passage.</p>

<p>“Are you sure this is the place?” he asked the
girls.</p>

<p>“Positive,” they all assured him, as they had
all taken note of the three dead trees.</p>

<p>“It’s strange, but I can’t see any way out of the
lake at this point,” spoke Jerry, standing up and
gazing ahead.</p>

<p>“I know it’s the place!” insisted Nellie.
“There, girls, see my handkerchief that I dropped
as I was baiting my hook!”</p>

<p>She pointed to the piece of linen on the bank.
There was no mistaking this bit of evidence.
Jerry ran the boat ashore and got out. The girls
followed him and Nellie recovered her handkerchief.</p>

<p>“This is the place we came through,” she said.
“The houseboat was moored right here.”</p>

<p>“But now it’s gone and the passage is closed
up!” exclaimed Jerry. “Something very strange
has happened.”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />
<small>OTTIBY TO THE RESCUE</small></h2>


<p>For a moment following Jerry’s announcement
the girls did not know what to say. The news
startled them.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell us that the passage by
which we entered here from Lake Okeechobee is
closed?” asked Nellie.</p>

<p>“It seems to be,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“And the houseboat is gone?” asked Rose.</p>

<p>“Where is it?” asked Ned. “You left it here
and now it has disappeared!”</p>

<p>“Poor father!” exclaimed Olivia. “What
can have happened to him?” and she looked at
the startled countenances of her sisters.</p>

<p>The girls were very much frightened, not only
at the disappearance of their houseboat but because
of the strange happening that had closed the
passage, and they were alarmed on account of their
father.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” asked Rose. “Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
those wicked colored men or some Seminole Indians
have captured father.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk of such horrid things!” exclaimed
Nellie. “We never should have left him
alone!”</p>

<p>“The best thing you can do is to come to our
camp,” suggested Ned. “We can tell the professor
what has happened and perhaps he can
suggest a way out of it. Maybe the passage has
become blocked by a mass of floating vegetation,
or an island such as we are on.”</p>

<p>“Are you on a floating island?” asked Olivia.</p>

<p>“Yes, a regular floating forest,” answered
Jerry. “I think you had better come with us.”</p>

<p>There was nothing else to do, and the girls got
into the motor boat while their small craft was
towed by the <i>Dartaway</i>. In a short time they
arrived at the camp. The professor met them at
the shore. He look worried, and Ned asked:</p>

<p>“Is anything the matter?”</p>

<p>“Bob is out of his mind again,” replied the
scientist. “He seems much worse. Did you
bring a list of medicines? I find I shall need several
kinds.”</p>

<p>“The houseboat is gone,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Gone?” and the professor’s face looked
blank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“And poor, dear papa is gone with her,” put
in Rose.</p>

<p>Jerry quickly explained what had happened and
Ned spoke of his theory.</p>

<p>“I believe you’re right,” agreed Uriah Snodgrass.
“We are in strange waters and things
have happened that I never would dream of. But,
girls, don’t worry. I’m sure your father is all
right. I wish I could find him, as I am worried
about Bob, and I’m sure he would have the very
medicine I need to make the boy well.”</p>

<p>“Let me assist in nursing him,” said Olivia.
“It will help to take my mind off our troubles.”</p>

<p>“We’ll aid you,” added Rose and Nellie, and
the three young ladies went into the tent where
Bob was tossing in the delirium of fever. The
professor was glad enough of their help and they
at once bathed Bob’s head, face and arms in
witch hazel which gave him some relief. They
also kept wet cloths on his brow to reduce the
fever.</p>

<p>“Now, boys, we’ve got a serious problem ahead
of us,” said Mr. Snodgrass as he beckoned Ned
and Jerry to follow him out of earshot of the
tent. “It seems that we are caught in a sort of
trap. We’re on a lake from which there appears
to be no outlet, and it is constantly falling. In a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
little while there’ll be no water in it and if we
want to get back home we’ll have to walk.”</p>

<p>“But there must be an outlet or how does the
water get out?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid the outlet is one that we can’t use,”
replied the scientist. “I mean an underground
one.”</p>

<p>“What’s to be done?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“I have thought of a plan,” Uriah Snodgrass
continued, “but it is going to be difficult for we
have no tools for working.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“We might cut a channel through the obstruction
that is blocking the passage through which
the girls came.”</p>

<p>“Or we might haul the boat overland,” added
Ned.</p>

<p>“Providing the floating island which blocks the
passage is not too great in extent,” put in Jerry.</p>

<p>This was a new phase of the matter. Clearly
they could not dig a canal of any great length,
with the primitive tools at their command. Nor
could they haul the <i>Dartaway</i> overland any long
distance.</p>

<p>“It looks as if we were up against it,” said
Jerry with a doleful sigh. “We’ll have to think
of another plan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment there was a cry from the tent
and the professor hurried to it, to find that Bob
was struggling to leave his cot because of a fever
delusion that there was a big snake near him.
The girls were frightened and it required all Mr.
Snodgrass’s strength to hold Bob down until the
spell passed. After that Ned, Jerry or the
professor remained on duty with one of the girls,
caring for the patient.</p>

<p>The camp was anything but a cheerful place.
The girls wore anxious looks, and the two boys,
in spite of their past experience in getting out of
serious difficulties, had lost some of their good
spirits. The professor did not give way to
gloomy thoughts, but it was clear that he was
worried.</p>

<p>In this way two days passed. Ned and Jerry
took turns in cruising about in the <i>Dartaway</i>,
looking for some means of egress from the lake,
but none was to be seen. It was at the close of
the second day that Jerry, returning in the motor
boat, saw a small craft approaching their island,
which was still drifting slowly.</p>

<p>“It’s a canoe,” he said, as he made the <i>Dartaway</i>
fast and waded ashore to camp. “I hope
it doesn’t contain an advance guard of ugly negroes
or Indians.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Thinking it best to be on the safe side, Jerry
quietly summoned the professor and Ned. They
got their guns and waited on shore. The canoe
continued to approach. The three girls were in
the tent with Bob.</p>

<p>“There are two men in it,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Then I guess we can take care of them,” remarked
the professor.</p>

<p>“If there aren’t a lot more to follow,” added
Ned.</p>

<p>On came the canoe. The two paddlers sent it
forward at a swift pace.</p>

<p>“They’re Indians,” observed Jerry a little
later. “One of ’em looks just like Ottiby.”</p>

<p>“It is Ottiby!” exclaimed the professor.</p>

<p>This was confirmed a few minutes later, when
the Seminole chief stepped ashore, followed by
another bronze-skinned individual.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted the chief. “Glad to see.
This my son, Skamore.”</p>

<p>“We’re glad to see you,” replied the professor.
“We’re in a bad fix and perhaps you can help us,
as you know a lot about these queer lakes.”</p>

<p>“Me help. Yo’ help Ottiby, Ottiby help yo’,”
and with that the Indian squatted down and began
to smoke a pipe, which example his son followed.</p>

<p>Waiting until the red-men had recovered from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the exertion of their paddling, the professor told
them of the plight of the party, and also of Bob’s
illness. He asked if Ottiby did not know of something
that was good for fevers. The chief
grunted and spoke to his son who, without a word,
glided off into the woods.</p>

<p>Then Ottiby began to talk. He said his son
would search for a certain plant that the Indians
used when they had fevers. As for the blocking
of the passage, that was another matter. Ottiby
said he and his son had come to the lake to fish.
He knew of no outlet from it other than the two
already described. One was impassable as it was
blocked by the falling of the water and the other
was closed by a mass of land&mdash;a veritable floating
island. The Indian said he had reached the
lake by an overland route; he and his son carrying
their canoe.</p>

<p>“But me help yo’,” finished the Indian. “We
go look at place in mornin’.”</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken than his son came hurrying
back through the bushes. His hands were
empty, showing that his search for the plant had
been unsuccessful. But there was a queer look on
his face. He spoke some words to his father, at
which the old chief started.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked the professor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hurricane coming,” was the answer. “Look
out, or all blow ’way.”</p>

<p>As he spoke there sounded a deep moaning
sound through the trees of the floating forest.</p>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>THE HURRICANE</small></h2>


<p>The words of the Seminole chief’s son were
startling enough, and, coupled as they were with
the strange sound of the wind, alarmed the boys
and the professor.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Rose, coming to
the tent flap as she heard the commotion outside.
It was the first time the girls were made aware of
the presence of the Indians. The professor explained,
asking the young ladies to remain cool as
the danger might not be as great as they feared.</p>

<p>“Oh! What will become of papa?” cried
Nellie. “His houseboat may be wrecked!”</p>

<p>“Maybe the chief knows something of the
<i>Wanderer</i>,” suggested Olivia to Mr. Snodgrass.
“Ask him, please.”</p>

<p>To the surprise of all the Indian chief said he
had seen the houseboat on Lake Okeechobee on
his way to Butterfly Lake. He described the location
and this showed it had moved away from
the blocked passage. Ottiby had not tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
enter Butterfly Lake through that waterway and
so, was not aware that it was choked up.</p>

<p>“He has seen father’s boat!” exclaimed Nellie.
“Was he all right?”</p>

<p>“Him walk back and forth on deck quick,”
replied the Indian with a smile.</p>

<p>Never had the boys seen such a disturbance of
the elements. The rain came down in sheets and
the tent, made of double canvas as it was, leaked
like a sieve. There was such power to the wind
that, had the tent not been protected by the surrounding
forest, it would have been blown over.</p>

<p>The girls were very much frightened, and cowered
down in a corner under such coverings as they
could secure to keep the rain from leaking in on
them. Bob was protected with his chums’ raincoats
and, throughout the hurricane, kept murmuring
in his delirium about pleasant sunshiny days.</p>

<p>At last the storm reached its height. The tent
seemed fairly to lift loose from the guy ropes, but
they were strong and well fastened, and the fury
of the wind was cheated. The thunder appeared
to gather all its powers for a tremendous clap,
following such a stroke of lightning that it seemed
as if the whole heavens were a mass of flame.
Then with an increase in the fall of rain, which
lasted for ten minutes and completed the drenching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
of everyone in the tent, the tropical outburst
was over.</p>

<p>Lanterns which had blown out were relighted
and the flaps of the canvas house opened. Ned
and Jerry hurried out to wring some of the water
from their clothes, while the professor sent them
to the motor boat, which had been covered with a
heavy tarpaulin, for some dry clothes for Bob.
The lightning still flickered behind a mass of
clouds in the east and brought out in sharp outline
the tops of the trees on the distant mainland.
Jerry looked at them for a moment. Then he
called out:</p>

<p>“Our island’s floating away faster than before!”</p>

<p>It needed but a glance to show this. Because of
the fury of the hurricane the floating forest had
been torn loose from the temporary anchorage on
the bottom of the lake and was being swept along
like a boat.</p>

<p>“I wish it would take us somewhere so’s we
could get off this lake,” remarked Bob, as he
pulled the <i>Dartaway</i> in and proceeded to get the
clothes from the lockers.</p>

<p>In the morning they found themselves several
miles from where they had been the night before.
The day was a fine one after the storm, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
girls forgot their fright and the discomforts of wet
clothes.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Rose suddenly, pointing ahead.
“There are the three dead trees that marked
where we left the houseboat.”</p>

<p>“So they are,” added Olivia. “Maybe this
island will float over there and we can see if the
houseboat is waiting for us.”</p>

<p>“But you forget the blocked passage,” said
Nellie.</p>

<p>The island, on which the party was, continued
to move slower and slower as the wind died out.
Jerry, who was aiding Ned in the task of getting
breakfast, went down to the shore of the floating
island for a pail of water. He saw the three dead
trees, and noted the girls looking at them and talking
about what has happened since they went fishing.
He also saw something else.</p>

<p>What it was caused him to drop his pail and
set up a shout. The professor and Ned, followed
by Ottiby and his son, came running up to him.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“The passage!” cried Jerry. “See, it is clear
now. The hurricane must have blown the mass
of trees and vegetation away and we can get into
Lake Okeechobee now!”</p>

<p>“Then we can get back to papa on the houseboat!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
exclaimed Olivia. “Oh, girls, isn’t it
fine! The very storm we were so afraid of has
done us a favor!”</p>

<p>“I’ll make sure of it,” Jerry went on, as he
and Ned got into the <i>Dartaway</i>. The girls insisted
on going also, and soon the five were puffing
toward where could be seen a narrow stream leading
from Butterfly Lake. In a short time they
were up to it and Jerry’s surmise was found to be
correct. The hurricane had blown the small floating
island clear through the passage into Lake
Okeechobee and that big body of water was now
accessible from Butterfly Lake.</p>

<p>“There’s the <i>Wanderer</i>!” exclaimed Olivia,
pointing ahead, and the others, looking, saw the
houseboat moored at the entrance to the passage.
They also saw Mr. Seabury pacing the upper deck.
At the sight of the motor boat he waved his hands
and set up a shout of welcome.</p>

<p>“Father! Father! Here we are!” cried
Nellie as Jerry sent the <i>Dartaway</i> straight for the
<i>Wanderer</i>.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a><br />
<small>NODDY’S DANGER</small></h2>


<p>They were all on board a few minutes later.
Mr. Seabury did his best to hug his three daughters
at once and shake hands with Ned and Jerry.
As for the talk&mdash;well, it would have taken half
a dozen phonographs of extra power to register
all that was said in a short time.</p>

<p>“There isn’t so much to tell,” said Mr. Seabury.
“When you girls went out in the boat, leaving
the <i>Wanderer</i> about where she is moored now I
was dozing on deck. Pretty soon Ponto called
my attention to a swarm of butterflies some distance
away. I had in mind the professor and his
search and I thought I might find just what he
wanted.</p>

<p>“We went after them, but they gave us quite a
chase, and when we thought we had them the
whole lot flew inland and we lost sight of them.
Then, when we came back where we had been
moored, near the passage, we found it was gone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
I was never so surprised in my life and I thought
I had made a mistake. I didn’t know what to
do and Ponto was so frightened he was of no
service. Then my old rheumatic trouble came
back with a rush and I had to take to bed. But
when the storm ceased I got better. I found the
boat had dragged her anchor, so I had Ponto start
the motor this morning and put us back as near as
possible to where the passage had been. To my
surprise it was open again. That’s all there is to
it. I don’t care what happened as long as I have
you girls back.”</p>

<p>“Nor we as long as we have you,” said Olivia,
with another hugging in which her sisters joined
her.</p>

<p>The boys and Mr. Seabury discussed what had
happened and came to the conclusion that all
around the two lakes, as well as in them, must be
large masses of floating vegetation in the form of
islands which drifted here and there. The falling
of Butterfly Lake would have affected Lake Okeechobee
by drawing water from it through the
second passage had not the small island acted as
a dam. When the passage was opened by the
hurricane blowing the island out of the way, there
would have been a strong current from Lake
Okeechobee into the other body of water but for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the fact that the smaller lake suddenly ceased
falling.</p>

<p>The boys learned later, from Chief Ottiby, that
Butterfly Lake was a strange one and frequently
fell as the water flowed off through some unknown
opening. Then it would as suddenly cease, and
regain its former level. This was now taking
place, and the water was again rising.</p>

<p>“Well, you boys certainly have had some queer
experiences since coming here,” remarked Mr.
Seabury when all that had happened in the last
few days had been told. “I have been wondering
what you came to Florida for.”</p>

<p>“We came for several reasons,” said Jerry.
“The professor wanted to get his rare butterfly,
but he hasn’t got it yet. We boys wanted some
adventures and we also had a message to deliver
to an acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we forgot to deliver it,” put in Ned.</p>

<p>“We will later, however,” resumed Jerry.
“Also I was going to look up some land my
mother owns somewhere down here.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly, but I suppose the deed
tells.” Later the widow’s son showed Mr. Seabury
the document.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“So your mother thinks this land is valueless,
eh?” asked the owner of the <i>Wanderer</i>.</p>

<p>“She always said she wished she had back the
money she paid for it.”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s likely to get it,” went on Mr.
Seabury.</p>

<p>“Where is it?”</p>

<p>“Just outside of Kissimmee City. I happen
to own a hotel there and this land is next to it.
For several years I have tried to get in communication
with the owner but was not successful.
Now I do so by accident.”</p>

<p>“Why did you want to find the owner?”</p>

<p>“Because I want to buy the land. I intend to
build an addition to my hotel, as the place where
it is located has become quite a summer colony.
I will give your mother a good price for the lot.
Do you think she will sell it?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure she will. In fact I think I’m safe
in offering it to you at a fair price. I don’t know
what it is worth, but I’m willing to leave it to
you.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t do business that way. When you
get to Kissimmee City, you can telegraph your
mother about the land. You can have it valued by
some real estate dealer, and I’ll pay you whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
he says it is worth. Is that satisfactory?” And
Jerry said it was.</p>

<p>“We mustn’t forget Bob!” exclaimed Ned,
after this business was concluded. “The professor
wants to know what kinds of medicine you
have, Mr. Seabury. Bob has a bad fever.”</p>

<p>“I have several kinds. I’ll take some of them
with me and go to your camp.”</p>

<p>In a short time Mr. Seabury, with Ned and
Jerry, was in the motor boat speeding toward the
camp. The three girls were left on the <i>Wanderer</i>.</p>

<p>The professor was glad to see Mr. Seabury,
and the two men discussed Bob’s case. The youth
was still in the stupor of the high fever, and Mr.
Seabury looked grave as he examined him. However,
he administered some strong medicine.</p>

<p>Whether the fever had run its course, or
whether the medicine Mr. Seabury gave him was
responsible, was not determined, but it was certain
by evening Bob was much better. He continued
to improve, and by the next day the fever had
entirely left him. Yet he was far from strong.</p>

<p>As the climate of Lake Okeechobee was not
doing Mr. Seabury any good he determined to
proceed back north. He left a supply of medicines
for Bob and, expressing the hope that the professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
would be successful in his search for the rare
butterfly, prepared to start the <i>Wanderer</i> on her
homeward trip. He agreed to meet Jerry in
Kissimmee City in three weeks and complete the
land sale in case Mrs. Hopkins agreed to it.</p>

<p>There was a little feeling of sadness when the
three boys bade the three girls good-bye, for they
had grown to be very good friends. They expressed
the hope that they would meet again soon,
and then, with three toots of her whistle, which
were answered from the motor boat, the <i>Wanderer</i>
puffed up Lake Okeechobee.</p>

<p>The boys and the professor decided to remain
in camp another week to allow Bob to recover
fully. At the end of that time they started back
up north, following the shores of Lake Okeechobee,
for Mr. Snodgrass was anxious about getting
the rare butterfly. Chief Ottiby and his son remained
on the other lake, as they wanted to do
some fishing.</p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> was not sent along at a very
fast speed, as the professor wanted time to scan
the shores in his search for insects. He began to
fear he must return north without the butterfly
which meant so much to him, and the boys, appreciating
his feelings, redoubled their watchfulness
in the hope of discovering the creature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“This looks like a good place for butterflies,”
said Mr. Snodgrass one afternoon, pointing to a
little cove which was bordered with woodland on
the edge of a swamp. “Suppose we camp here
for a few days?”</p>

<p>The boys were willing, and the boat was headed
toward shore. There was a long strip of firm
land before the swamp was reached and on this
the tent was erected. Then, while the professor,
with long rubber boots on, went into the morass
to look for the butterfly the boys walked in another
direction.</p>

<p>They had not gone very far when Jerry, who
was in the lead, called out:</p>

<p>“Somebody else is camping here.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Bob, who had fully recovered
from his illness.</p>

<p>“There’s a tent.”</p>

<p>“Can’t be much of a party in that,” observed
Ned. “It’s only about big enough for one.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I guess there’s the ‘one,’” observed
Bob, pointing to where a solitary figure
stood on a little hummock near the edge of the
swamp. Jerry took one look at the figure and
uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Boys! If that isn’t Noddy Nixon I’m a
Dutchman!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon?” repeated Bob.</p>

<p>“It sure is,” added Ned. “But look there!
An alligator is right behind him!”</p>

<p>“And he doesn’t see it!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>It was true enough. Noddy was standing with
his back to the saurian. He seemed to be gazing
off into the swamp as if looking for some one.</p>

<p>“Hurry up and put a bullet into it!” yelled
Bob, for Jerry had brought his gun along.</p>

<p>“We haven’t time! Let’s yell to Noddy to
jump out of the way of its tail!” suggested Ned.
“Now all together!”</p>

<p>They united their voices in a shout of warning
but Noddy never turned.</p>

<p>“He must be deaf!” exclaimed Jerry. “I’ll
have to try a shot, but it’s pretty long.”</p>

<p>There was nothing else to do. He raised the
rifle and fired. The alligator gave a spring into
the air and Noddy wheeled around.</p>

<p>“He heard that!” cried Ned, springing forward.
The alligator was evidently mortally
wounded. <a href="#image04">Noddy gave one look at the</a> leaping,
<a href="#image04">writhing saurian</a> almost at his feet. Then he
looked at the three chums who were running toward
him. An instant later he had disappeared
into the swamp-forest.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a><br />
<small>THE BUTTERFLIES&mdash;CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p>“Well of all the queer actions!” exclaimed
Jerry as he reached the spot where the alligator
was stretched out dead. “I think Noddy must
be crazy!”</p>

<p>They discussed the matter at some length and
decided they had better tell the professor about it.
They found the scientist tired out with his long
and unsuccessful search for the rare butterfly.</p>

<p>“Maybe Noddy’s troubles have sent him temporarily
out of his mind,” said Mr. Snodgrass.
“I think it is our duty to do what we can for him,
even if he has, in the past, acted as the enemy of
you boys. We’ll go see him in the morning.”</p>

<p>They started off early the next day for Noddy’s
camp. As they approached they saw the youth
standing in the same place he had occupied the
previous day.</p>

<p>“Hey, Noddy!” called Jerry when still some
distance away from him.</p>

<p>“The wind is blowing the wrong way. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
can’t hear you,” remarked Mr. Snodgrass. “Try
again.”</p>

<p>“Noddy!” called Jerry. Still Noddy did not
turn his head. Then all three boys united in a
chorus of shouts. The Cresville bully gave no
indication of having heard them.</p>

<p>“He’s deaf!” exclaimed the professor, and
this view of the matter was confirmed a moment
later when Ned, having touched Noddy on the
shoulder, was confronted by a very much surprised
youth. Jerry, Bob and Mr. Snodgrass
joined Ned at Noddy’s side. The latter looking
in wonderment from one to the other, took out a
piece of paper and a pencil and, handing them to
Jerry, said:</p>

<p>“I am totally deaf. I ate some queer kind of
red berries and I’ve lost my hearing. You’ll have
to write out your questions for me.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” wrote Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’m camping here until I have that dispute
over the cocoanut grove settled,” Noddy replied
with something of his old manner. “I’ve got a
colored man staying with me. When I found I
was deaf I sent him off to the village for some
medicine. He hasn’t come back and I guess he
ran away with my money. I was watching for
him to come on a path through the swamp yesterday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
when that alligator got after me. I couldn’t
hear you when you yelled at me, but I felt the
ground tremble when the alligator threshed
around after you shot it. I was so frightened
that I ran away.”</p>

<p>The professor, who was impressed by Noddy’s
plight, urged him to accompany the boys back
north. The three chums were willing to let by-gones
be by-gones, and aid their former enemy,
who was glad enough to accept help. His money
was all gone and his food supplies running low.
What he would have done had not the boys discovered
him would be hard to say.</p>

<p>Noddy’s tent was taken down and he was
brought to the other camp. There, made miserable
by his deafness and his failure to secure a
cocoanut grove, he sat apart, refusing to talk.</p>

<p>That evening, when the three chums were beginning
to wonder if Mr. Snodgrass had not become
lost in the swamp, they heard a shouting
along the path that led through the morass.</p>

<p>“That sounds like him,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“It is!” exclaimed Ned a moment later as the
professor came into view. He was fairly leaping
up and down, holding something in his hands.</p>

<p>“Did a snake bite you?” inquired Jerry anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“No! I’ve got three of the butterflies! I
caught them in the swamp a few minutes ago!”
cried the delighted professor, and, hurrying up to
the boys he showed in a little glass-sided box, the
beautiful insects. The bodies were pink, while
the large wings were of mingled blue and gold.</p>

<p>“I’ve got them!” repeated Mr. Snodgrass.
“They were feeding on some beautiful flowers
and first I thought they were blossoms, but their
wings moved and I put the net over them. Now
I’ll get the reward and a commission to travel all
over the world for the museum. Oh, boys!
This has been a most delightful trip!”</p>

<p>“With certain parts left out,” murmured Jerry,
and Bob agreed with him.</p>

<p>“We’ll start back to-morrow,” went on the
scientist. “I want to get these butterflies to the
museum as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>They broke camp the next morning. Noddy,
sullen and unhappy, accompanied them. Now
that his mind was at peace from having secured
his prize, the professor began to study Noddy’s
case. He learned what the red berries were, and
by looking in some of his scientific books discovered
a remedy. This he administered the unfortunate
youth who, in a few days, had his hearing
completely restored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’d better give him the message now,” said
Jerry one afternoon, and, as communication was
now easier Noddy was told of being wanted as a
witness in the lighthouse matter. He said nothing
on hearing this, but showed by his manner
that he was alarmed.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he’ll answer that summons,”
ventured Jerry, and he was right. The next
morning Noddy’s bunk in the <i>Dartaway</i> was
vacant. He had slipped away in the night.
However, the chums did not worry about him as
they were near Kissimmee City and they thought
Noddy could take care of himself, now that his
hearing was restored.</p>

<p>Mr. Seabury was found at the hotel adjoining
the land Jerry’s mother owned. In response to
a telegram from her son, Mrs. Hopkins authorized
him to sell the land to Mr. Seabury, and it
was disposed of for a goodly sum.</p>

<p>“You must stay at my hotel for a week or so,”
said the gentleman to the boys. To this they
agreed. Uriah Snodgrass, however, took the first
train he could get for the north.</p>

<p>“Where are you going next?” asked Rose, of
Jerry one day.</p>

<p>“We haven’t made up our minds,” answered
Jerry. “Where are you going?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“We three girls are probably going with papa
to California. He thinks the climate there may
do him good.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to go to California myself,” put in
Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, and sail on the Pacific,” added Bob.
“Say, that would be fine, eh?” he cried.</p>

<p>“We’d like to meet you out there,” said Nellie.</p>

<p>“It would be glorious!” cried Jerry. And
how they did meet, and what strange adventures
befell all, will be told in another volume, which I
shall call, “The Motor Boys on the Pacific; Or,
The Young Derelict Hunters.” It was an outing
that none of them ever forgot.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s nothing to keep us down south
any longer, I guess,” remarked Jerry one morning.
“What do you say that we start back
north? The professor has gone on with his butterflies,
I’ve sold mother’s land, and we did Noddy
a good turn.”</p>

<p>“Not to mention that we had more adventures
than we counted on,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“And met some nice girls,” added Ned, with a
sigh, for Ned had rather a soft spot in his heart
for all young ladies.</p>

<p>“Then let’s arrange to go home,” urged Jerry,
and they did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>So here, for a time, we will take leave of the
motor boys. That they were destined to take
part in many more incidents seems very probable,
for they were boys who did not hesitate to undertake
anything that offered a spice of novelty, nor
were they deterred by a little flavoring of danger.</p>
